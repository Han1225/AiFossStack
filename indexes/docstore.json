\n The Board of Auditors has audited the financial statements and reviewed the \noperations of the United Nations as reported in volume I for the year ended \n31 December 2022. The audit included an examination of financial transactions and \noperations at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the offices at Geneva, Vienna \nand Nairobi and other entities, including selecte d special political missions.  \n \n  Audit opinion  \n \n In the Board\u2019s opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material \nrespects, the financial position of the operations of the United Nations as reported in \nvolume I as at 31 December 2022 and its financial performance and cash flows for \nthe year then ended, in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting \nStandards (IPSAS).  \n \n  Overall conclusion  \n \n The overall financial position of the Organization as at 31 December 2022 \nremai ns sound. Approximately 99 per cent of the regular budget was used in 2022, \nleaving an underexpenditure of approximately $40.14 million. The Administration \nneeds to continue to strengthen core business processes in budget, finance, assets \n(including the st rategic heritage plan) and human resources management. The Board \nalso identified areas for improvement in the operations of development, peace and \nsecurity, humanitarian affairs, and information and communications technology.  \n \n  Key findings  \n \n  Accounts and financial reporting  \n \n  Financial overview  \n \n Total revenue for the year 2022 amounted to $7.35 billion, a slight decrease from \n$7.55 billion in 2021, which was due mainly to a decrease of $0.41 billion in voluntary \ncontributions. With regard to expenses, the total amount was $7.71 billion in 2022, an \nincrease of $1.03 billion (15 per cent), compared with $6.68 billion in 2021, which was \ndue mainly to an increase of $0.63 billion in grants and other transfers, as well as those \nexpenses related to travelling and other operating expenses which had significantly \nincreased since the recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic.  \n Net assets for the year 2022 increased by $1.2 billion (34 per cent), from \n$3.51  billion as at 31 December 2 021 to $4.71 billion as at 31 December 2022, which \nwas due mainly to the actuarial gains on employee benefits liabilities ($1.51 billion).  \n \n  Liquidity management  \n \n The overall financial situation for the year 2022 was relatively healthy. For the \nregular budget and related funds, the cash ratio was 0.26, 0.76 and 0.69 at the end of \n2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, indicating a relatively good liquidity situation, bu t \nperiodic cash shortages still existed. The regular budget continued to borrow from the \nWorking Capital Fund during 2022 owing to the periodic cash shortages. At the end \nof 2022, there were no borrowings from the Working Capital Fund, the Special \nAccount  or closed peacekeeping missions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80325892-f3b1-4cbf-91b5-710ad2b7afdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "80325892-f3b1-4cbf-91b5-710ad2b7afdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65144c51-7787-4009-a49a-27f388083d37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "bb766525e84a9e7dba2f346f0c22d3e4ea094b1c1fef03836cfaf9528f8abf03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1847c897-1dd5-4137-b230-8547ecf15852", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "3db206e6f95066ccbb10c786568ec4daa6b020f9e285e17978f07734fe58858e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "42f9b9bc-ce5c-453d-bbad-ea48394a80c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "6174994b3ccbc279dfb8324d05872bdb63a78871404c457d1ce8c3f634ea22f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "81d0835bc547a3d7d67002377aa6f2b07695ea3e35df57339819ec97b4551265", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  11/396 \n  The Administration informed the Board that, although the trend of increasing \nyear-end arrears had been reversed, the fluctuations in regular budget collections \nincreased uncertainty and the risk of rushed year -end spend ing. Therefore, the \nAdministration needed more adequate and predictable liquidity to ensure the \nexecution of the regular budget operations.  \n \n  Budget management  \n \n  Improvements needed for transparency of extrabudgetary resources in the proposed \nprogramme budget  \n \n The total proposed regular and extrabudgetary resources for humanitarian \nassistance (section 27) of the proposed programme budget only included expenditures \nfor mandated programmatic activities directly implemented by the Office for the  \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, ranging from $352 million to $364 million from \n2020 to 2022. The grants and transfers from the country -based pooled funds, the Central \nEmergency Response Fund and specially designated contributions to implementing \npartners, ranging from $1.55 billion to $2.56 billion from 2020 to 2022 according to \nrelevant financial statements, were excluded from the proposed extrabudgetary \nresources. This gave rise to a difference between the presentation of financial \nstatements and t he programme budget. A similar case was noted for the political affairs \nsection (section 3) of the proposed programme budget, in which the Peacebuilding Fund \nwas not disclosed and its expenditures in 2022 amounted to $195.58 million.  \n \n  Lack of clarity in  asset allocation rules leading to inaccuracy in budget proposals for \nspecial political missions  \n \n The budget proposals for vehicles and computing devices of some sampled \nspecial political missions were not accurate to the extent possible. For instance, w hen \npreparing the budget proposals for 2022 at year -end 2020, the existing passenger \nvehicle holdings of 13 missions (68 per cent of 19 sampled missions) had already \nexceeded their standard allocation for vehicles for 2022, and the existing computing \ndevic e holdings of 19 missions (50 per cent of a total of 38 missions) had already \nexceeded their standard allocation and spares quantities for 2022.  \n As at 31 December 2022, the actual vehicle holdings of 15 missions (79 per cent \nof 19 sampled missions) had e xceeded their standard allocation quantity for 2022, and \nthe actual computing device holdings of 26 missions (68 per cent of a total of 38 \nmissions) had exceeded their standard allocation and spares quantity for 2022.  \n \n  Continuous overexpenditure on furn iture and equipment  \n \n The Board noted an upward trend of overexpenditure  on furniture and \nequipment from 2019 to 2022. In 2022, expenditure on furniture and equipment of all \n36 sections totalled $49.79 million, with an overexpenditure rate of 71 per cent, with \nthe political affairs section having the largest overexpenditure am ount, at \n$16.48  million. This may indicate that overall internal control mechanisms in this \nregard needed further improvement. For instance, the United Nations Integrated \nTransition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS) overspent by 34 per cent on \nfurniture and equipment in 2022, with total expenditure of $3.26 million, including \n$1.3 million for 45 vehicles and $0.49 million for 429 computing devices. As at \n31 December 2022, UNITAMS held 149 vehicles and 594 computing devices \n(including 134 devices tha t were idle) for a total of 231 staff members.  \n \n  Weaknesses in mobile communication services usage and cost reimbursement  \n \n In 2022, at 18 sampled special political missions, 47 per cent of costs for mobile \ndevice services related to non -official commun ications and 30 per cent of personnel", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42f9b9bc-ce5c-453d-bbad-ea48394a80c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "42f9b9bc-ce5c-453d-bbad-ea48394a80c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d54cfa3-dac8-4515-bac5-58a02562cf74", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "b39c2d627f19ed8ec28f0b0c196d328c87b83af99bc585912444f6f00928463c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80325892-f3b1-4cbf-91b5-710ad2b7afdb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "81d0835bc547a3d7d67002377aa6f2b07695ea3e35df57339819ec97b4551265", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1514b921-eb29-46d3-965d-d5fc51d01906", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "5e131973cff612c6a1723ffd5c8f59d108a8fcaa4a8b6c6dde6bfb42bf02956e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6174994b3ccbc279dfb8324d05872bdb63a78871404c457d1ce8c3f634ea22f0", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n12/396 23-11009  \n used mobile devices only for private purposes.

First, there were some discrepancies between the actual status \nof heritage items and their records in Umoja. Second, the warehouse under the United \nNations Secretariat building was not in an i deal condition for the storage of heritage \nitems.

First, the Administration awarded the project before the contractor had \nattained the status of a qualified level 2 vendor, thereby failing to ful ly comply with \nthe requirements of the United Nations Procurement Manual. Second, the \nAdministration did not terminate the contract in a timely manner when the contractor \nwas unable to fulfil its obligations. Third, there was a lack of action regarding a j oint \nventure's liability for contract termination costs. These deficiencies resulted in a delay \nof 42 months from the approved project timeline and preliminary estimated losses of \n$3.69 million owing to the termination of the initial contract.  \n \n  Strategi c heritage plan of the United Nations Office at Geneva  \n \n The completion of the works for the project, initially scheduled for the end of \n2023, has been extended until December 2025 according to the strategic heritage plan \nteam, and potentially until July 2026 according to an independent risk analysis.

The main \nrecommendations are that the Administration:  \n \n  Budget management  \n \n (a) Make appropriate disclosures on the funds received in its budget \ndocuments to ensure transparency;  \n (b) Update the vehicle holding ratio and related guidance, as well as the \ncomputing device allocation \u201cratio\u201d, as part of the Standard Cost and Ratio \nManual in order to enabl e the missions to improve the transparency and quality \nof vehicles and computing devic es budget proposals in the future;  \n (c) Continue to monitor budget implementation, in particular for those \nentities with continuous overexpenditure on furniture and equipment, in \naccordance with the parameters established by the General Assembly;  \n (d) Inform respective entities to implement the mobile communication \nservices recovery and refund mechanism to ensure that non -official mobile \ncommunication service costs are recovered and refunded to the regular budget \nin a timely manner;",

Mandate, scope and methodology  \n \n \n1. The United Nations, founded in 1945, provides the main forum for its 193 \nMember States to meet and take collective measures through its principal organs: the \nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the \nTrusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice and the Secretariat. Under the \nCharter of the United Nations, the Organization can take action on a wide range of \nvital and complex issues. The Organization comprises a Headquarters in New York \nmade up of multiple departm ents and offices, as well as entities and offices away from \nHeadquarters and projects across the globe.  \n2. The financial statements for the operations of the United Nations as reported in \nvolume I encompass the full range of activities, entities and progr ammes falling under \nthe auspices of the Secretariat and include all funds other than those of the peacekeeping \noperations, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, the United \nNations Human Settlements Programme (UN -Habitat) and the Unit ed Nations \nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), among others, which are reported separately.  \n3. The 2022 financial statements were prepared under the International Public \nSector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and comprise five separate primary statements \nsupported  by explanatory notes.  \n4. The Board of Auditors has audited the financial statements of the United Nations \nas reported in volume I for the year ended 31 December 2022 in accordance with \nGeneral Assembly resolution 74 (I) . The audit was conducted in conformity with the \nFinancial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, the International Standards \non Auditing and the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions f or the \nfinancial audit of public sector entities. The latter require that the Board comply with \nethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance as \nto whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  \n5. The Board conducted the audit at various offices and departments at United \nNations Headquarters in New York and the offices in Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi, as \nwell as selected special political missions.

The audit was conducted primarily to enable the Board to form an opinion as to \nwhether the financial statements presented fairl y the financial position of the United \nNations as at 31 December 2022 and the results of its operations and cash flows for \nthe financial period, in accordance with IPSAS. This included an assessment as to \nwhether the expenses recorded in the financial stat ements had been incurred for the \npurposes approved by the governing bodies and whether revenue and expenses had \nbeen properly classified and recorded in accordance with the Financial Regulations \nand Rules of the United Nations. The audit included a general  review of financial \nsystems and internal controls and a test examination of the accounting records and \nother supporting evidence to the extent that the Board considered necessary to support \nits audit opinion.  \n7. The Board also reviewed the operations of the United Nations under regulation \n7.5 of the Financial Regulations and Rules, focusing on areas of fundamental \nimportance to the capability, effective management and reputation of the United \nNations, in particular finance and budget, cash and investment,  assets (including the \nstrategic heritage plan) and human resources management.

With regard to the ageing of the 140 pending recommendations, 16 (12 per cent) \nhad been pending for more than three years and 20 (14 per cent) for three years; 38 \n(27 per cent) had been made two years ago and 66 (47 per cent) had been made one \nyear ago. Th e reasons those recommendations are pending can be attributed mainly \nto workplan implementation schedules and timelines, as some recommendations \ninvolve multiple accountable entities or are composed of several elements.  \n10. Of the 37 open recommendations relating to the Umoja system as at \n31 December 2022, 19 (51 per cent) had been implemented, 17 (46 per cent) were \nunder implementation and 1 (3 per cent) had been overtaken by events (see annex II).  \n11. In addition, as at 31 December 2022, of the 29 outsta nding recommendations \nrelating to the strategic heritage plan project, 17 (59 per cent) had been fully \nimplemented, 9 (31 per cent) were under implementation, 1 (3 per cent) was not \nimplemented and 2 (7 per cent) had been overtaken by events (see annex III ). \n12. Furthermore, as at 31 December 2022, of the 16 outstanding recommendations \nrelating to the ICT strategy, 2 (13 per cent) had been implemented, 13 (81 per cent) \nwere under implementation and 1 (6 per cent) had been overtaken by events (see \nannex IV).  The Board is concerned about the oldest recommendations, which have \nbeen pending since 2012.  \n13. Lastly, there were two outstanding recommendations relating to the capital \nmaster plan, of which one had been fully implemented and one was still under \nimplem entation as at 31 December 2022 (see annex V).  \n \n 2. Accounts and financial reporting  \n \n (a) Financial overview  \n \n14. Total revenue for the year 2022 amounted to $7.35 billion, a slight decrease \nfrom $7.55 billion in 2021, due mainly to the decrease of $0.41 billion in voluntary \ncontributions. The decrease in revenue from voluntary contributions was attributable \nmainly to the upfront recognition of revenue related to 2022 in 2021 by the Central \nEmergency Response Fund in accordance with the IPSAS principle of early \nrecognition of unconditional revenue under multi -year agreements. With regard to \nexpenses, the total amount was $7.71 billion in 2022, an increase of 15 per cent \ncompared with $6.68 billion in 2021, driven by a $0.63 billion increase in grants and \nother transfers, due primarily to the provision of additional humanitarian assistance \nfor projects in Ukraine and Afghanistan during 2022. There was also a 27 per cent \nincrease in expenses related to travelling and other operating expenses compared with \nprior years (2022: $0.95 billion; 2021: $0.75 billion) owing to the recovery from the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic.  \n15. Net assets for the year 2022 increased by $1.20 billion (34 per cent), from \n$3.51  billion as at 31 December 2021 to $4.71 billion  as at 31 December 2022, which \nwas due mainly to actuarial gains on employee benefits liabilities (2022: \n$1.52  billion; 2021: 0.48 billion).  \n \n (b) Liquidity management  \n \n16. The Board continued its review of the liquidity situation of the operations of the \nUnited Nations as reported in volume I through a ratio analysis and noted that the \nmain liquidity ratios (i.e. cash ratio, quick ratio and current ratio) had declined from \nthe previous year, due mainly to the increasing average duration of cash investments . \nTotal assets remained stable compared with the previous year while total liabilities \ndecreased by 15 per cent, resulting in an improvement in the solvency ratio, as shown \nin table II.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4d46e8e-e666-49c1-8bb7-c4b925bfb7d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4d46e8e-e666-49c1-8bb7-c4b925bfb7d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "578338e6-6afc-4190-8cff-ca46fc156e77", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "8786b6641974ead739abfd523383ea8650a1b060c69ef5356336fa86b83d0413", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5174070e-55f6-45b2-8d71-1b0ed44555da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "076f1bc59acbc9fc32845c92a91779183bd2d5251532027da74f8d5fb43c8c98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2677edb-adf5-4709-8c95-a81694e68e0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "b0fa37c6e297fb5699208d88a9fe02c6ccd09de7b22b6aea1b7efc81bd1b0039", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "20b744b73fc4d10ce30e58a6d40462e1297b28d0992aabfd54ef5f6d29968187", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  23/396 \n   Table II.2  \n  Ratio analysis for the operations of the United Nati ons as reported in volume I  \n \n \nFinancial ratio  31 December \n2022  31 December \n2021  31 December \n2020  31 December \n2019  31 December \n2018  \n      Cash ratioa      \nCash plus short -term investments: \ncurrent liabilities  2.31  2.69  2.48  2.73  2.84  \nQuick ratiob      \nCash plus short -term investments plus \naccounts receivable: current liabilities  3.05  3.44  3.51  3.78  3.85  \nCurrent ratioc      \nCurrent assets: current liabilities  3.28  3.81  3.79  4.11  4.24  \nSolvency ratiod      \n Total assets: total liabilities  1.68  1.43  1.27  1.33  1.54  \n \nSource : Based on data provided by the Administration.  \n a The cash ratio is an indicator of an entity\u2019s liquidity by measuring the amount of cash, cash \nequivalents and invested funds there are in current assets to cover current liabilities.  \n b The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio because i t excludes inventory and \nother current assets, which are more difficult to turn into cash.

In its resolution 72/266  A, the General Assembly approved the \nproposed change f rom a biennial to an annual budget period, on a trial basis, \nbeginning with the programme budget for 2020. According to the proposed \nprogramme budget for 2022 and the corresponding Assembly resolution, the total \nappropriations for 2022 approved by the Asse mbly  amounted to $3.26 billion, the \nestimates for other assessed resources amounted to $420.14 million and \nextrabudgetary resources were estimated at $12.78 billion.  \n21. In its first report on the proposed programme budget for 2022 ( A/76/7 ), the \nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions focused on budget -\nrelated topics, including vacancy rates, the proposed ICT -related resources and \ndisclosure of extrabudgetary resources.

The Board reviewed the proposed programme budgets for humanitarian \nassistance (section 27) from 2020 to 2022 as well as their supplementary information, \nand noted that the total proposed regular and e xtrabudgetary resources from 2020 to \n2022 were $352 million, $361 million and $364 million, respectively (with estimated \nextrabudgetary resources of $334 million, $344 million and $346 million), for \nexpenditures for mandated programmatic activities directl y implemented by the \nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The estimated allocations from \nthe country -based pooled funds, the Central Emergency Response Fund and specially \ndesignated contributions to implementing partners were excluded from the \nextrabudgetary resources, with only a footnote outlining the estimated allocation \namounts from the country -based pooled funds and the Central Emergency Response \nFund, which did not include the estimated expenditure/allocation amounts of \nspecially desig nated contributions.  \n25. The Board noted, however, that all grants and transfers to implementing partners \nfrom the country -based pooled funds, the Central Emergency Response Fund and \nspecially designated contributions were consolidated into the financial s tatements of \nvolume I. Therefore, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as a \nvolume I entity responsible for the coordination of humanitarian assistance, is the \nprincipal entity responsible for the pooled funds of country -based pooled fu nds, the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund and specially designated contributions. The \nrevenues and expenses of those pooled funds were recorded under two trust funds \n(32DDN and 32CER), including six country -based pooled funds administered by the \nUnited Nati ons Development Programme (UNDP).

The Administration explained that the purposes of the prop osed programme \nbudget and of the United Nations financial statements differ and therefore, the \nextrabudgetary estimates reported in the proposed programme budget will not be \naligned with those reflected in the financial statements. The exclusion of \nextrabu dgetary estimates relating to the country -based pooled funds, the Central \nEmergency Response Fund and specially designated contributions was due to the fact \nthat the amounts are allocated to other United Nations entities, funds and \nprogrammes, and to parti cipating organizations; hence, to include these estimates in \nthe proposed programme budget proposals may result in the double counting of \nextrabudgetary estimates reported in the proposed programme budget.  \n27. The Board holds the view that, going forward, disclosing estimated allocations \nto implementing partners from country -based pooled funds, the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund and specially designated contributions in the programme budget \nwould better present the financial resources required for  implementing humanitarian \nactivities and improve the completeness and transparency of programme budget \nformulation.  \n28. A similar observation was made for the proposed programme budget for \npolitical affairs (section 3), in which the Peacebuilding Fund was  not disclosed \nalthough its expenditures in 2022 amounted to $195.58 million. Considering the \nmandate of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, the responsibilities \nof the Peacebuilding Support Office and the inconsistencies between the sco pe of the \nfinancial statements and the programme budget, the Board is of the view that the \nDepartment of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs should disclose the funds received \nin its budget documents to ensure transparency and completeness.  \n29. The Board r ecommends that the Administration make appropriate \ndisclosures on the funds received in its budget documents to ensure transparency.  \n30. The Administration accepted the recommendation and will disclose in a \nfootnote, where appropriate, the estimated resour ces for the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund, the country -based pooled funds and specially designated \ncontributions in the context of the extrabudgetary resource estimates presented in the \nproposed programme budget for the Office for the Coordination of Hum anitarian \nAffairs.

In its previous audits ( A/76/5 (Vol. I) , chap. II, paras. 86 \u201391, and A/77/5 (Vol.  I), \nchap. II, paras. 123 \u2013128), the Board had noted some variances between the number \nof planned and actual extrabudgetary p osts for various Secretariat entities and \nrecommended that the Administration disclose information on extrabudgetary posts \nmore transparently, and review estimated extrabudgetary posts more strictly, to ensure \nthat the extrabudgetary resource estimates pre sented in the budget fascicles were as \ncomplete and accurate as possible.  \n33. The Board continued its review in this regard for five sampled entities in 2022, \nand noted that two entities had high variances between the number of planned and \nactual extrabud getary posts. With regard to the Department of Political and \nPeacebuilding Affairs and the United Nations Office at Nairobi, the number of \nestimated extrabudgetary posts outlined in their 2022 budget proposals were 81 and \n240 respectively, while the actual  extrabudgetary posts as at 31 December 2022 were \n106 and 276 respectively. Although the variances between the actual and estimated \nextrabudgetary posts had been reduced over the past two years, there was a continuous \ntrend of a variance rate of more than 30 per cent for the Department of Political and \nPeacebuilding Affairs. For the United Nations Office at Nairobi, the variance rate \nincreased from 12 to 15 per cent. Details are shown in table II.6.  \n \n  Table II.6  \n  Comparison between planned and actual ext rabudgetary posts  \n  (Number of posts)  \n \n \n 2021   2022  \nEntity  Planned  Actual  Planned  Actual  \n     Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs  76 100 81 106 \nUnited Nations Office at Nairobi  232 260 240 276 \n Total  308 360 321 382 \n \nSource : Based on data provided by the Administration and extracted from Umoja.  \n \n \n34. The Board further analysed the reasons for the variance between the budget \nestimation and the actual number of extrabudgetary posts and noted that, at the United \nNations Office at Nairobi,  the variance was due mainly to new established positions \nfunded by the cost -recovery fund (10RCR). With regard to the Department of Political \nand Peacebuilding Affairs, 86 of the 106 actual extrabudgetary posts were funded by \na trust fund (32SZA), while t he number of estimated extrabudgetary posts in the \nproposed budget for 2022 was only 81.  \n35. The Administration explained that a systematic review had been conducted for \nall extrabudgetary posts and entities were encouraged to keep only those posts that \nwere to be used in the subsequent budget period.

Considering the volatile nature \nof extrabudgetary funding, it would be difficult to ensure further accuracy in \nprojections even with significant extra effort.  \n36. The Administration also indicated that the Department of  Political and \nPeacebuilding Affairs would continue to make efforts to expand its donor base and \nincrease the predictability of available funding, including through securing multi -year \nfunding agreements with several donors, to further enhance the annual e stimation of \nextrabudgetary posts.  \n37. The Board also noted that in the proposed programme budget for 2022 for \nspecial political missions, only 13 extrabudgetary positions were included, while the \nactual number of extrabudgetary positions totalled 91, lead ing to 78 positions \n(including 67 posts funded by voluntary contributions, 7 general temporary assistance \npositions, 2 billing positions and 2 positions funded by voluntary contributions to \nprojects) that were not reported in the proposed budget. Of the 67  posts fund by \nvoluntary contributions that were not reported, 26 had been established before \nFebruary 2021 (when the budget proposal was submitted) and should have been \nincluded in the budget proposal.  \n38. The Board recognized the improvements made by the  Administration with \nregard to the continual reduction in the overall variance between actual and estimated \nextrabudgetary posts in the past two years, and encouraged those entities with a high \nvariance rate to take actions to increase the accuracy in term s of the projection of \nposts funded by extrabudgetary resources.  \n39. The Board further reviewed the budget guide for special political missions and \nnoted that the guide only requested the missions to include one or two paragraphs in \nthe report describing the amount of extrabudgetary resources. The guide did not, \nhowever, request that special political missions report the number of extrabudgetary \npositions.  \n40. The Board is concerned that the lack of clarity in the provisions relating to \nextrabud getary resource reporting in the budget guide has resulted in the insufficient \ndisclosure of extrabudgetary resources, which may have an impact on the accuracy \nand transparency of the proposed programme budget.  \n41. The Board recommends that the Administrat ion revise the budget guide to \nexplicitly request special political missions to provide more detailed information \non financial as well as human resources when reporting extrabudgetary \nresources in the proposed programme budget.  \n42. The Administration accep ted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Lack of detailed information on the grants and contributions category in \nbudget  proposals  \n \n43. In its resolutions 75/252  and 76/245 , the General Assembly endorsed the \nAdvisory Committee\u2019s conclusions and recommendations to include a consolidated \nlist and a comprehensive analysis and breakdown of the grants and contributions \ncategory in future budget proposals in order to improve the transparency and \nconsistency of information related to these resource requirements.  \n44. In accordance with the budget guides for 2021 and 2022, when a grant to an \norganiza tion is not based on specific legislation, details on the authority of such a \ngrant, the purpose, grantee, the amount and the period covered should be provided.

The Board reviewed the proposed programme budget and the supplementary \ndocuments of 36 sections for 2022 and noted insufficient information with regard to \nthe grants and contributions category:  \n (a) Information abo ut legislative authority or related funding agreements was \nnot disclosed in 21 sections, in an amount of $149.73 million. For example, the Office \nfor Disarmament Affairs, the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the Office for \nthe Coordination of Humanita rian Affairs and the Department of Global \nCommunications proposed grants and contributions in an estimated amount of \n$1.98  million for the funding of staff or other personnel, but none of those entities \nfully disclosed the number of personnel, the funding period, staff grades, the \napplicable vacancy rates and the criteria for calculating the grants;  \n (b) There was a lack of comprehensive analysis and a breakdown of grants \nand contributions for section 23, Regular programme of technical cooperation. In \n2022 , section 23 proposed an estimated budget of $7.59 million for the 11 \nimplementing entities that participate in the regular programme of technical \ncooperation. However, there were no detailed analyses and breakdowns provided for \neach entity regarding the u se of the grants.  \n46. In addition, although the grants provided through the Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs to UNDP, in the amount of $1.08 million, were \npursuant to General Assembly resolution 52/12  B, the resolution was adopted in 1997 \nand indicated that the funding period was only for the biennium 1998 \u20131999. \nSimilarly, grants from ECA in the amount of $134,000 to the United Nations African \nInstitute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders were in \naccordance with Assembly resolution 54/130 , adopted in 1999, which referred only \nto the mobilization of f inancial resources for the Institute without specifying that the \nfunding arrangement would be extended until 2022.  \n47. The Board is concerned that the lack of sufficient disclosure for the grants and \ncontributions budget, especially with regard to breakdow n analyses, may affect the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s decision -making on the proposed programme budget.  \n48. The Board recommends that the Administration enhance guidance and \noversight on the formulation of the programme budget to ensure that all entities \nincrease the disclosure of comprehensive analyses and breakdowns for the \nproposed grants and contributions in future budget proposals.   \n49. The Administration accepted the recommendation and explained that the \nproposed programme budget for 2024 was being finalized,  in accordance with the \ndirection of the General Assembly, to include a detailed table with the breakdown of \ngrants and contributions. The Board will follow up on this issue in its next audit.  \n \n (iv) Lack of clarity in asset allocation rules led to inaccur acy of budget proposals of the \nspecial political missions  \n \n50. The General Assembly, in its resolution 70/286 , stressed the importance of \nfurther steps by the Secretary -General towards improving budget presentations and \nmaking more accurate forecasts. In its report on observations and recommendations \nrelated to peacekeeping operations ( A/70/742 ), the Advisory Committee on \nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions continued to stress that every effort should \nbe undertaken to improve the accuracy of budgetary estimates.  \n51.

Among the 13 missions, the 5 with the most significant variances between \nexisting vehicle holdings at the end of 2020 and the standard vehicle allocation for \n2022 are shown in table II.7.  \n \n  Table II.7  \n  Top five special political missions with the most significant variances between \nexisting vehicle holdings at the end of 2020 and standard allocations for 2022  \n \n \n Existing passenger \nvehicle holdings at \nthe end of 2020  Standard \nvehicle \nallocations  Variance  Rate of \nvariance \n(percentage)  \n     Office of the Special Envoy of the \nSecretary -General for Syria  40 12 28 233 \nUnited Nations support team to the \nCameroon -Nigeria Mixed Commission  10 4 6 150 \nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in \nSomalia  121 60 61 102 \nUnited Nations Support Mission in Libya  78 42 36 86 \nUnited Nations Integrated Office in Haiti  46 27 19 70 \n \nSource : A/76/6 (Sect. 3)/Add.1 , table 2, and vehicle list (excluding utility vehicles, buses, etc.) \nprovided by the United Nations, summarized by the Board.  \n \n \n53. For instance, at the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in \nthe Suda n (UNITAMS), the standard allocation for vehicles for the Mission in 2022 \nwas 22, which was same as its proposed holdings for 2022. However, the number of \nexisting passenger vehicles by year -end 2020 for the Mission was 26, which exceeded \nboth the proposed  holdings for 2022 and the standard allocation for vehicles. In \naddition, UNITAMS held 149 passenger vehicles as at 31 December 2022, which was \n577 per cent over its standard vehicle allocation.  \n54. UNITAMS explained that it had inherited 85 vehicles in 20 21 that had already \nexceeded their useful life and were scheduled to be disposed of in 2023. In addition, \nthe Mission had procured 45 new vehicles in 2022, 30 of which were only physically \nreceived in February 2023 owing to issues related to customs cleara nce. Finally, 19 \nvehicles were exclusively used by the Under -Secretary -General, the Assistant -\nSecretary -General and other high -level visitors, and should not be included in the \ncalculation of the transportation ratio.  \n55. The Board is of the view that, as the 85 inherited vehicles were marked as being \nin good condition in Umoja, the vehicles to be disposed of in 2023 should have been \nincluded in the proposed budget for 2022.

The Administration explained that certain computing devices are designated for \ncommon areas, such as the car log system an d telephone billing and training rooms, \nwhile others are tablets that are not included in the standard allocation calculation.  \n61. The Board reviewed the Standard Cost and Ratio Manual and identified certain \nobscurities in the criteria that may lead to dif ferent interpretations regarding the \ncalculation of standard allocations. For instance, the Manual does not specify vehicle \nallocation rules for experts and consultants, and there is a lack of clear classification \nof vehicles used for close protection and certain security tasks in the interim \nguidelines for a transition plan for the transformation of the global Department of \nField Support vehicle fleet, issued in 2016. In addition, the Manual does not provide \ndetails on the allocation of computing devices f or experts and consultants, computing \ndevices used in common areas and tablets.  \n62. The Board is of the view that the clear classification of different vehicles and \ncomputing devices may enable the missions to provide more relevant information \nwith regard to vehicle and computing devices in their proposed budgets, which may \nalso enable the legislative bodies to better evaluate the reasonableness of the relevant \nbudget proposals and avoid the over -allocation of equipment, the idleness of assets \nand low asset  utilization rates to the extent possible.  \n63. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that the special \npolitical missions conduct a comprehensive analysis of the root causes for the \nsignificant variances between actual vehicle and computing de vices holdings and \nstandard allocations.   \n64. The Board also recommends that the Administration update the vehicle \nholding ratio and related guidance, as well as the computing device allocation \n\u201cratio\u201d, as part of the Standard Cost and Ratio Manual in orde r to enable the \nmissions to improve the transparency and quality of vehicles and computing \ndevices budget proposals in the future.  \n65. The Administration accepted the recommendations.  \n \n (b) Deficiencies in the information and communications technology budget review  \n \n66. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions recalled \nin its report on the information and communications technology strategy \n(A/77/7/Add.22 ) that the previous information and communications technology \nstrategy placed emphasis on the optimal utilization of relevant resources, which was \nto be achieved through the defragmentation and harmonization of existing \ninfrastructure an d processes.  \n67. According to paragraph 2.2 (g) of the Secretary -General\u2019s bulletin \n(ST/SGB/2016/11 ), the Office of Information and Communications Technology is \nresponsib le for the review of budgets and projects from all funding sources for all \nICT initiatives and operations of the Secretariat before their submission to the Office \nof Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts.

The Board is of the view that the review by the Office of Information and \nCommunications Technology did not function as intended (to ensure estimated \nresources for ICT were duly forecasted) owing to the failure of many entities to \nsubmit budget proposals.  \n \n (ii) Lack of guidelines to ensure the quality of the information and communications \ntechnology budget review  \n \n71. The Board noted that the Office of Information and Communications \nTechnology had not formalized guidelines on the information and methods for review \nof the ICT budget proposals submitted by the entities.  \n72. The Board is concerned that the lack of well -established g uidelines for review \nmay lead to inconsistent standards when relevant budget proposals are reviewed and \nto entities investing in, inter alia, ICT infrastructure, equipment, software and \napplications that are not standardized or aligned with the overall ICT  strategy, which \nmay result in fragmentation, and compromise the efforts of the Office of Information \nand Communications Technology to promote the mainstreaming of platforms and \nproducts.  \n \n (iii) Lack of effective follow -up measures to ensure entities impl ement the requests and \nrecommendations of the Office of Information and Communications Technology  \n \n73. The Board was informed that 24 entities had been requested to provide \nadditional information about their submitted ICT budget proposal to the Office of \nInformation and Communications Technology.

In its previous report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap.

The Board continued its review in this regard and noted that the actual \nexpenditure on furniture and equipment of all 36 sections totalled $49.79 million in \n2022, compared with the appropriation of $29.14 million, with an overexpenditure \nrate of 71 per cent.  \n79. Further structural analysis revealed that 23 sections under the operations of the \nUnited Nations as reported in volume I had a total amount of $22.17 million in \noverexpenditures on furniture and equipment in 2022. In particular, section 3, \nPolitical affairs, had the largest overexpenditure amount of $16.48 million, \naccounting for 74 per cent of the total overexpenditure.  \n80. The Board also conducted a trend analysis in this regard and noted that total \noverexpenditure on furniture and equipme nt amounted to $6.88 million, \n$7.93  million, $22.27 million and $20.64 million in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, \nrespectively, among which nine sections under the operations of the United Nations \nas reported in volume I had overexpenditures for four consecutiv e years, as shown in \nfigure II.I  \n \n  Figure II.I  \n  Sections of United Nations operations as reported in volume I with overexpenditure on \nfurniture and equipment for four consecutive years (2019 -2022)  \n  (Thousands of United States dollars)  \n \n \n \nSource : Based on data provided by the Administration.  \n \n \n81.

Therefore, no budget was allocated to the Mission for purchasing new \nvehicles and computing devices in 2022.  \n83. However, the Bo ard noted that the actual expenditure on furniture and equipment \nfor the Mission totalled $3.26 million in 2022, with an overexpenditure rate of 34 per \ncent, financed by redeployments from \u201cgeneral operating expenses\u201d. Of the actual \nexpenditure of $3.26 mi llion, $1.30 million was utilized for the acquisition of 45 \npassenger vehicles and $0.49 million was spent on the purchase of 429 computing \ndevices. The Board also noted that as at 31 December 2022, UNITAMS had 231 staff \nmembers and 149 passenger vehicles,  as well as 594 computing devices, of which 134 \nwere listed as idle. Furthermore, a new commitment was created by the Mission on 29 \nDecember 2022 for the acquisition of 43 passenger vehicles valued at $1.5 million . \n84. The Administration explained that UNI TAMS did not have a proposed budget \nfor vehicle acquisition in 2022, as the Mission had been relying on the possibility of \ntransferring vehicles from the now -closed African Union -United Nations Hybrid \nOperation in Darfur. However, the Board noted that the transfer had been completed \nat mid -year 2021. In addition, the Mission had not proposed a budget for vehicles in \nthe supplementary budget ( A/76/6 (Sect. 3)/Add.7 ) in October 2021. As a result, the \nMission used budget redeployments to purchase vehicles for replacement.  \n85. Similar observations were made with regard to the United Nations Verification \nMission in Colombia and the United Nations Investigative Team to Prom ote \nAccountability for Crimes Committed by Da\u2019esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.  \n86. The Administration explained that it had updated budget guides and issued \nnotices to special political missions for both 2023 and 2024 reminding them to adhere \nto the requirements related to vehicle and laptop holdings in the Standard Cost and \nRatio Manual. The Administration also requested all that missions justify budget \nredeployments in accordance with these requirements.  \n87. The Administration further indicated that once the management reform was \ncompleted, programme managers were delegated the authority to manage the budgets \napproved for their entities, and redeployment across budget classes was permitted \n(with the exception of redeployments between po st and non -post budgets) to ensure \nthe most efficient and effective implementation of mandates. In addition, the use of \ndelegated authority was monitored by providing sufficient guidance on budget \nredeployment, and had two separate workflows for the approv al of budget \nredeployments: \u201cALR1\u201d for approval at the level of the entity/office/mission, and \n\u201cALR2\u201d for approval at the central level by the Office of Programme Planning, \nFinance and Budget.  \n88. The Board further analysed the budget redeployments of furn iture and \nequipment in 2022 and noted that, based on the policy, the Office of Programme \nPlanning, Finance and Budget only approved 1.14 per cent of a total overexpenditure \nof $20.64 million.  \n89. The Board recognized the efforts and enhancements made by th e Administration \nin monitoring budget redeployment by updating the budget guide and the financial \nperformance report. However, an overexpenditure for certain budget classes for \nconsecutive years was still noted, which indicated that the overall internal co ntrol \nmechanism needed further improvement.  \n90.

As stated in the information circular on mobile communication devices for \nofficial work ( ST/IC/2005/11 ), the Information Technology Services Division (now \nintegrated into the Office of Information and Communications Technology) was to \ncharge req uesting offices for the actual usage of mobile communication devices. User \ndepartments would be billed on a monthly basis for the full reimbursement of all \ncharges resulting from the use of mobile communication devices and certifying \nofficers would ensure that charges for personal calls were recovered from the user.  \n93.

The Board was informed that an e -billing system was implemented to monitor \nmobile device usage and a cos t-recovery mechanism was put in place to monitor and \nrecover costs from the use of mobile devices for private calls.  \n95. In 2022, the Board reviewed the data generated by the e -billing systems of a \nsample of 18 special political missions and noted that:  \n (a) A high proportion of mobile communication costs were used for \nnon-official purposes. On average, the overall proportion of mobile communication \ncosts used for private purposes was 47 per cent in 18 missions; the highest proportion \nwas 90 per cent in 1 mission. Of the 18 missions, 7 used more than 50 per cent of \ntheir mobile communication costs for non -official purposes;  \n (b) A high proportion of personnel used mobile communication devices only \nfor non -official purposes. On average, 30 per cent of perso nnel used mobile devices \nonly for private purposes in 18 missions; the highest proportion of such use was 65 \nper cent for 1 mission, while in 4 missions more than 50 per cent of their personnel \nused mobile communication devices only for non -official purpos es.  \n96. Further review of the recovery and refunds for the costs of private calls for 18 \nmissions from 2018 to 2022 revealed that, of a total $2.39 million in private call costs, \n$1.43 million (60 per cent) had not been recovered, and $2.3 million (96 per  cent) \nhad not been refunded to the regular budget -related funds. As for United Nations \nHeadquarters, the Board noted that of the $6.98 million in costs recovered from 2018 \nto 2022, $6.92 million (99 per cent) had not been refunded to the regular budget -\nrelated funds.  \n97. The Board is of the view that the large proportion of costs for calls dedicated to \nprivate purposes may indicate that the appropriated regular budget for mobile \ncommunication services in the special political missions is not strictly used for its \ndefined purposes.  \n98. The Board is also concerned that the large portion of private call costs that has \nnot been recovered or returned to the regular budget -related funds in a timely manner \nis not compliant with the budget guidelines, and is not i n the best interests of the \nUnited Nations.  \n99. The Administration explained that it has implemented technical controls \nthrough the e -billing system in which users of mobile services are able to mark their \ncalls as \u201cprivate\u201d, which automatically triggers c ost-recovery from payroll during the \nnext billing cycle.  \n100.

The Board recommends that the Administration update its policies to \nemphasize monitoring mobile device service usage for non -official purposes.  \n102. The Board also recommends that the Administration inform respective \nentities to implement the mobile communication services recovery and refund \nmechanism to ensure non -official mobile communication service costs are \nrecovered and r efunded to the regular budget in a timely manner.  \n103. The Administration accepted the recommendations.  \n \n (iii) Inefficient use of information and communications technology resources for \nvideoconferencing support services  \n \n104. According to the budget guid elines for field technology operations issued by the \nOffice of Information and Communications Technology, each mission should make a \nprovision for the estimated cost of videoconferencing support services managed \ncentrally by the Office.  \n105. The Board note d that the Office of Information and Communications \nTechnology actually contracted with the United Nations Office for Project Services \n(UNOPS) to provide the above -mentioned videoconferencing support services. As \nprovided in related financial agreements an d amendments, the number of bridged \nevents was one of the critical parameters for estimating the videoconferencing support \nservices received, which remained stable from 2019 to 2022. However, the Board \nnoted that the actual total number of videoconferencin g bridged events decreased \nsignificantly from 2019 to 2022, as shown in table II.11, while the actual annual costs \nfor videoconferencing support from 2019 to 2022 was $1.78 million.  \n \n  Table II.11  \n  Estimated and actual number of videoconferencing events for all field missions  \n \n \n 2019  2020  2021  2022  \n     Estimated supported events according to financial \nagreements  18 500  18 500  22 000  22 000  \nActual events  22 466  9 267  9 836  3 825  \n \nSource : Actual data provided by the Office of Information and Communications Technology; \nestimated data extracted from financial agreements.  \n \n \n106. The Board further sampled three missions, namely the United Nations \nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the United Nations Verification \nMission in Colombia and the United Nations Mission to Support the Hudaydah \nAgreement, and noted a significant decrease in the number of videoconferencing \nbridged events from 2019 to 2022, while relevant charges for the support services \nremained nearly uncha nged.  \n107. The Administration explained that the use of videoconferencing support \nservices sharply decreased because other systems were deployed during the COVID -\n19 pandemic to support meetings. New virtual meeting platforms were introduced \nincluding Micro soft Teams, Webex, Zoom and the remote multilingual platforms. \nVery often the videoconferencing bridge was the mechanism used to connect these \nplatforms.

The Board is of the view that the obvious gaps between the significant decline \nin the number of v ideoconferencing bridged events and the unchanged charges for the \nservices may indicate an inefficient use of ICT budget resources, and the need for the \nAdministration to review the reasonableness of the charges for the videoconferencing \nsupport services.  \n109. The Board recommends that the Administration consider the actual \ndeployment and the revised role of the videoconferencing team when updating \nthe agreements with the United Nations Office for Project Services.  \n110. The Administration accepted the recom mendation.  \n \n (d) Insufficient disclosure of special commitments in financial performance reports  \n \n111. The General Assembly, in its resolution 76/246  A, requested that the approval \nof fund commitments be reported with detailed justifications in the financial \nperformance report of the Secretary -General to improve transparency, and in its \nresolution 77/263 , also requested that the Secretary -General include all relevant \ninformation on the establishment and utilization of commitments in future financial \nperformance reports to improve transparency, accountability and oversight.  \n112. In its previou s report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap II, para. 85), the Board noted that as \nat 31 December 2021, the balance for special commitments established in 2020 was \n$17.74 million. Th e Board continued to review the utilization of these special \ncommitments and noted that a further $14.20 million in open commitments was \nexpensed in 2022 and the remaining $3.54 million was cancelled. However, the \nrelated information was not disclosed in t he financial performance report. In addition, \nthe amount of $1.41 million established at the end of 2019 for special commitments \nbut cancelled in 2022 was also not included in the financial performance report.  \n113. The Administration explained that various  documents had been used to disclose \ninformation on the special commitments and that currently, the request to include all \nrelevant information on the establishment and utilization of commitments was under \nimplementation during the preparation of the finan cial performance report for 2022.  \n114. The Board is of the view that information disclosures regarding the \nestablishment, utilization, cancellation and unused balances of special commitments \ncreated in 2019 and 2020 in the financial performance reports wer e insufficient, and \nmay not provide the legislative body with a holistic picture of the financial \nperformance of the Organization.  \n115. Following the Board\u2019s observation on the insufficient disclosure of special \ncommitments in financial performance reports , an overview of the establishment, \nutilization and cancellation of the special commitments created in 2019 and 2020 was \nprovided in annexes X and XI of the financial performance report on the programme \nbudget for 2022 ( A/78/89 ). \n \n 4.

Other top entities with a significant amount of \nthe 10RCR accumulated surplus as at 31 December 2022 included the U nited Nations \nOffice at Geneva ($66.35 million, 15 per cent), the United Nations Office at Nairobi \n($55.70 million, 12 per cent), the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific ($25.11 million, 6 per cent), and UNAMA ($24.79 million, 5 per cen t). \n \n  10RCR reserve management  \n \n122. The Board noted that the total amount of $452.92 million accumulated surplus \nas at 31 December 2022 was approximately 1.6 times the 2022 10RCR expenses \n($280.78 million). The percentage of the accumulated surplus, compared with annual \n10RCR expenses (i.e. reserve ratio) among the entities varied significantly, from 51 \nto 321 per cent, as shown in table II.12.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e7b7328-b9aa-4036-b3c4-1511aafd29c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e7b7328-b9aa-4036-b3c4-1511aafd29c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4949fb7-829e-4d4c-8a05-23450e509d1a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9ed3f6ccfacadee42fc60de478c1b3c17c8359bca75739dbd0c7c91e6098c378", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "330cf366-35a5-442e-9f77-b640128ffd42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ba124e44e4948b3fa5ea88ecbaab500d3992c404286886ce108ae0c01672b122", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33801e17-ce55-45f8-af01-305ea02102d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "50754981de589d72a4cad7d40d66fed559815da43263dd226f22822e69431ed6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e7d6f7570dc20ff8fe8faa9cc3484a8406b365ebf1db28ce9964272781117168", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n42/396 23-11009  \n   Table II.12  \n  Variance analysis of the 10RCR reserve ratio among entities  \n  (Millions of United States dollars)  \n \n \nBusiness \narea  Entity  Expense of fiscal \nyear 2022  Accumulated \nsurplus  Reserve ratio \n(percentage)  \n     R400  Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific  7.81  25.11  321 \nM007  United Nations Assistance Mission for \nIraq 8.99  24.35  271 \nS400  United Nations Office at Vienna  7.58  17.02  225 \nS100  United Nations Headquarters  121.88  215.90  177 \nS300  United Nations Office at Nairobi  31.48  55.70  177 \nM006  United Nations Assistance Mission in \nAfghanistan  14.72  24.79  168 \nS200  United Nations Office at Geneva  51.22  66.35  130 \nR500  Economic and Social Commission for \nWestern Asia  7.53  5.19  69 \nR100  Economic Commission for Africa  10.11  6.58  65 \nM015  United Nations Support Mission in Libya  15.00  7.58  51 \n \nSource : Based on data from the ERP Central Component in Umoja.  \nNote : When expense > 0 and accumulated surplus > $5 million.  \n \n \n123.

The previous information technology system (the Integrated \nManagement Information System) did not have the granularity for relevant revenue \nand expenses that Umoja ha d, which led to the legacy accumulated surplus. For \ninstance, the legacy fund SAN collect ed the insurance recovery revenue and expenses \nrelating to damage in the aftermath of Storm Sandy. The legacy fund OJA was used \nto account for services (medical, security and mail) provided by United Nations \nHeadquarters to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fu nd (UNICEF), UNDP and the \nUnited Nations Population Fund in New York.

According to the user guide on grantee management, closing a grant involves \ntwo stages,  operational closing and financial closing, before a grant status can be \nchanged to \u201cclosed\u201d. In the operational closing stage, all financial transactions can be \nrecorded, except for new budget and commitment transactions. Before moving to the \nfinancial cl osing stage, outstanding commitments, invoices and adjustments must be \nprocessed. In the financial closing stage, only refunds to donors and transfers of \nunspent balances are allowed. Once the final financial statements are issued, and the \nunspent balances  are returned or repurposed the grant status can be changed to \n\u201cclosed\u201d, and no further transactions are allowed.  \n165. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance establishes \npolicies and strategies, monitors the exercise of delegated aut hority and assesses \ncompliance with legal and policy frameworks.  \n166.

The Administration explained that it had taken steps to improve grants \nmanagement, such as sending an annual list of inactive grants, from receipt to closure, \nto responsible entities and establishing a grants management dashboard to review the \nstatus of gran t budgets and cash balances.  \n169. The Board is of the view that the unspent balances of the closed and \noperationally closing grants, where applicable, should be addressed in a timely \nmanner to ensure the efficient utilization of funds. In addition, grants marked as \n\u201coperationally closing\u201d should be closely monitored to ensure that each grant serves \nits intended mandate in accordance with the agreement with donors and is managed \nappropriately, reflecting its current status.  \n170.

The Administration explained that the 20 per cent operating reserve policy was \npartly outdated and the current level of net assets balance had not yet reached a level \nthat was considered sufficient for coverage of the unfunded large future liabilities and \ncontingent reserves. Therefore, the Administration was in the process of reviewing \nand updating the policy, drawing on the memorandum issued in 2012 and subsequent \nguidance issued by the Controller, notably to reflect the changes derived from the \nenhanced delegation of authority.  \n191. The Board recommends that the Administration expedite its review and \nrevision of the administrative instruction on programme support accounts to \nensure the effective utilization of the programme support cost funds.   \n192. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n 7. Cash and investment management  \n \n193. In order to centralize cash management for the United Nations and reduce \ntransaction costs, a house bank structure was implemented in Umoja. Each bank \naccount serves a sp ecific currency/location need and is available for all United \nNations entities/funds and missions. Cash is consolidated, and this cash pool \nincorporates investment pooling, which has been in place since 2001. The allocation \nof assets and revenue within the  cash pool is determined by the principal balance of \neach participating entity. The United Nations Treasury is responsible for managing \ncash and investments and supporting the opening and closing of bank accounts \nworldwide. As at 31 December 2022, there we re 254 house bank accounts in Umoja.  \n194. Assets are combined and managed as two separate investment pools: one main \npool in United States dollars and one pool in euros. The Treasury also provides \ninvestment services for United Nations Staff Mutual Insuran ce Society against \nSickness and Accidents funds. Based on investment responsibilities, two investment \nguidelines have been established: one for the main and euro pools, and the other for \nthe United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society funds. Treasury -specific limits \nhave been set to provide a list of recommended banks and securities brokers/dealers \nfor investment purposes. As at 31 December 2022, the cash pools (main pool and euro \npool) held total assets of $11,886.4 million (2021: $11,812.7 million), of which \n$5,608.0 million (2021: $ 5,372.3 million) was due to the Organization, and its share \nof revenue from cash pools was $21.9 million (2021: $8.4 million).  \n \n (a) Unclear definition of portfolio concentration limits in the United Nations \nInvestment Management Guidelines  \n \n195. The United Nations Investment Management Guidelines document the \nTreasury\u2019s investment management policies for the cash pools. To better control the \nTreasury\u2019s investment management, certain portfolio concentration li mits were set \nout in the annex to the Investment Management Guidelines.  \n196. The Board reviewed those predetermined limits on investment and noted two \ncases that had ambiguities which may lead to different interpretations. For example, \nthe limit for debt instruments issued by banks, brokers/dealers, financial institutions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4ccd462-fa41-4901-9830-0c856cfe9832": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4ccd462-fa41-4901-9830-0c856cfe9832", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3704c4-6680-4f19-9765-f715edd81bfd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "114ac17e7447167629dfbf9c32536f773bb8441f1c3550250a4342650b36f6db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "03951c15-677a-4bb8-9806-f1d17a0fad85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "248a3a47cae0b231376f24773cf7bc7483d464aef8fcb88965f0a3d198c4bb6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3104035c-a98f-4900-9ad0-110ae2464ee9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "84f574d633966b3da3f1d0f8951fd6389546b2d82a5a9ca0da7a41ff50992ad5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4d2f17e640b12e398fc9f57282469a2160dae66d0ba01da2e3551a7373252788", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n58/396 23-11009  \n and corporations is 5 per cent of any single outstanding issue or bond offering for \neach pool. The limit here has two different interpretations, each of which results in a \ndifferent contr ol amount for investment. One interpretation limits the investment \namount to 5 per cent of the outstanding issue size, while the other limits the \ninvestment amount to 5 per cent of the cash pool size.  \n197. This ambiguity was also echoed in the compliance rules of the Bloomberg Asset \nand Investment Manager system. According to United Nations compliance procedures,  \ncompliance rules are predetermined and configured in the Bloomberg Asset and \nInvestment Manager system to ensure the implementation of investment  policies \nduring investment management. The Asset and Investment Manager system should be \nin harmony with the Investment Management Guidelines and Treasury -specific limits \nat all times. With regard to the limit of 5 per cent of any single outstanding issue  or \nbond offering for each pool, there are two Asset and Investment Manager system \ncompliance rules set: one is to limit the investment amount to 5 per cent of its \noutstanding issue size, and the other is to limit the investment amount to 5 per cent \nof the  cash pool size. However, for other similar rules, only one compliance rule in \nthe Asset and Investment Manager system is applied.  \n198. The Board is concerned that the unclear definition in the Investment \nManagement Guidelines may result in different inter pretations of the same rule, and \nthat different compliance rules in the Asset and Investment Manager system for \nsimilar Investment Management Guidelines may also result in misunderstanding.  \n199. The Board recommends that the Administration clearly define t he meaning \nof each set of limits in the United Nations Investment Management Guidelines to \navoid different interpretations, and amend the related Asset and Investment \nManager compliance rules accordingly.  \n200. The Administration accepted the recommendation . \n \n (b) Different rule setting for credit rating in the United Nations Investment \nManagement Guidelines  \n \n201. The United Nations Investment Management Guidelines document the \nTreasury\u2019s investment management policies for the cash pools and, together with the \nUnited Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and Accidents Swiss \nFranc Investment Guidelines, form the basis for the overall investment of the United \nNations Staff Mutual Insurance Society funds. Investments managed by t he Treasury \nneed to be in harmony with those investment guidelines at all times.  \n202. In the annexes to both sets of guidelines, three different sources of credit ratings \nare mentioned, namely S&P Global Ratings, Moody\u2019s and Fitch. The Board was \ninformed t hat every investment is required to satisfy the criteria of at least one of \nthese three credit ratings and there is no order of priority.  \n203. However, the Board noted that some credit rating descriptions in the guidelines \nmay lead to a misunderstanding t hat criteria for all three credit ratings need to be met, \nsince there was no clear indication that the satisfaction of criteria for only one was \nenough. For example, the credit rating requirements for debt instruments issued by \nbanks, brokers/dealers, fina ncial institutions and corporations in the guidelines were \nbonds with at least one minimum credit rating of AA -, Aa3 or AA -, or A -1 or P -1 for \nmoney market instruments. The credit rating requirements for debt instruments issued \nby sovereign, government -guaranteed, supranational and agency issuers were, for \nmedium - and/or long -term maturities, a minimum credit rating of AA -, Aa3 or AA -, \nand for money market instruments a short -term rating of A -1, P-1 or F -1 as of the \ntrade date, but there was no mention of w hether all of those ratings, or just one rating, \nneeded to be met.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3104035c-a98f-4900-9ad0-110ae2464ee9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3104035c-a98f-4900-9ad0-110ae2464ee9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cb0aa571-2378-4a71-8b3f-76b1e3e837ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "13b60fe7dee327bff85477b24bb860667946cf61fe3107ec47b731a31d7325e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4ccd462-fa41-4901-9830-0c856cfe9832", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "4d2f17e640b12e398fc9f57282469a2160dae66d0ba01da2e3551a7373252788", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "181096d1-1f3f-40e4-81a5-066f68c6393a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "f546459df2fc578dba2a5dcaf6d05144e4788962ce03de34031fe665231875d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "84f574d633966b3da3f1d0f8951fd6389546b2d82a5a9ca0da7a41ff50992ad5", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  59/396 \n 204. The different descriptions may lead to different interpretations, as sometimes an \ninvestment may have a different credit rating under S&P Global Ratings, Moody\u2019s \nand Fitch. For example , the Fitch rating of company \u201cD\u201d was downgraded to A from \nAA- on 1 July 2022, while the Moody\u2019s rating was downgraded to Aa3 from Aa2 on \n7 July 2022, resulting in different credit ratings, as Aa3 and AA - are considered equal \nin the guidelines.  \n205. Furth ermore, the Board noted the statement in the investment guidelines for the \nUnited Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society that, for the purposes of the \nguidelines, credit ratings were prioritized in the following order: S&P Global Ratings, \nMoody\u2019s and Fitch . This may also lead to a misinterpretation that there is a priority \nfor credit -rating selection, while in practice there is not.  \n206. The Board is concerned that the different descriptions in relation to credit -rating \nrequirements in the guidelines may re sult in a misunderstanding of the credit rating \nrules and may lead to disharmony in actual investment practices.  \n207. The Board recommends that the Administration clarify the credit rating \nrules in the investment guidelines to ensure that the actual invest ment practice \nis consistent with the rules.  \n208. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (c) Incorrect allocation of investment revenue among different entities  \n \n209. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations provide that revenue \nfrom General Fund investments shall be credited to it as investment revenue, and \nrevenue from investments pertaining to trust funds and special accounts shall be \ncredited to the trust fund or special account concerned (rule 104.15 (a) and (b)) and \nthat inv estment losses shall be borne by the fund, trust fund, reserve or special account \nfrom which the principal amounts were obtained (rule 104.16 (b)).  \n210. United Nations entities participate in the United Nations Treasury main pool in \norder to improve overall investment performance and reduce risk. At the end of each \nfinancial year, the Finance Division allocates cash pool assets (including cash and \ncash equivalents, short -term investments and long -term investments) and investment \nrevenue/deficit based on each participating entity\u2019s principal balance.  \n211. The Board reviewed the 2022 main pool year -end reclassification process and \nnoted that the investment gains/losses of some funds were manually allocated to other \nfunds from other entities. For instance , the investment revenue belonging to the \n20PCR fund was incorrectly allocated to the 10RCR fund, leading to an extra realized \ngain of $1.51 million and an extra unrealized loss of $0.65 million, which were \nincorrectly included in the financial performance  of the operations of the United \nNations as reported in volume I. These amounts should be added back to volume II. \nIn addressing the concerns of the Board, the Administration agreed to make the \nadjustments in subsequent financial statements.  \n212. The Board  is of the view that manual adjustments and interventions related to \ninvestment revenue during the financial closure process may involve inherent risk, \nwhich should be appropriately addressed by the Administration.  \n213. The Board recommends that the Admini stration strengthen its review of the \nmapping between cash pool assets and associated investment revenue at year end \nto ensure the completeness and accuracy of relevant financial disclosures in the \nfuture.   \n214.

Health insurance programme  \n \n215. The United Nations has established medical and dental insurance plans as part \nof the social security scheme for its staff, retirees and eligible dependants. Most of \nthe plans are self -insured and are managed at two  locations: New York and Geneva. \nIn the case of self -insurance plans, the Organization and plan participants assume the \nrisk of providing health insurance to the plan participants. The plans are administered \nby third -party administrators on behalf of the U nited Nations or, in the case of the \nUnited Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and Accidents, self -\nadministered. The third -party administrators receive the claims for the services \nprovided to the staff members, retirees and eligible de pendants who are members of \nthe insurance plans on behalf of the United Nations, scrutinize them and determine \nthe payments to be made against the claims. As of December 2022, the self -insurance \nplans covered 227,576 participants, including staff members, retirees and dependants \nfrom the Secretariat and other participating organizations such as UNICEF, the Office \nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), UNDP and the \nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU). In 2022, an amount of $636 .25 million  \nin claims was paid under those plans.  \n216. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in its \nreport on managing after -service health insurance ( A/76/579 ), concurred with the \nrecommendation of the Board of Auditors on the urgent need to improve internal \ncontrols over medical insurance expenditure, including by establishing adequate \ninternal control mechanisms. In this respect, the Board continue d its review of the \nhealth insurance programme of the United Nations, focusing on the execution of \nmandated cost -sharing ratios, reserve management, accounts receivable for health \ninsurance funds and the appropriateness of medical expenditure, and noted th e issues \npresented below.  \n \n (a) Deficiencies in reserve management of health insurance plans  \n \n217. According to the report of the Secretary -General on managing after -service \nhealth insurance liabilities ( A/68/353 ), the United Nations maintains a health \ninsurance reserve to manage premium fluctuations and meet unanticipated catastrophic  \nclaim requirements. The benchmark for plans  based in the United States of America, \nsuch as the Aetna plan and the Cigna Dental plan, is to maintain reserves equivalent \nto about three to four average months of claim costs, while non -United States -based \nplans, such as the United Nations worldwide pla n for international staff and the \nUnited Nations Medical Insurance Plan for United Nations locally recruited staff at \ndesignated duty stations away from Headquarters, need to maintain reserves \nequivalent to about six to eight average months of claim costs.  The reserves of the \nUnited Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society are maintained in accordance with \nstatutory requirements.  \n218. The Administration also indicated that the health insurance industry has \nundergone significant changes since the report of the  Secretary -General ( A/68/353 ) \nwas published in 2013, including as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. This has led \nto increased health -care costs, potentially requiring an incr ease in the level of reserves \nfor self -insured health insurance plans. Some participants have postponed medical \ntreatment, resulting in higher health -care costs, so there is a need to increase operating \nreserves to ensure there are sufficient funds for fut ure claims.  \n219.

In a previous audit ( A/76/5 (Vol. I) , chap. II, paras. 142 \u2013148), the Board had \nnoted continuous deficits with regard to the United Na tions Medical Insurance Plan \nand highlighted a risk of insufficient reserves for the Plan. The Board continued its \nreview in this regard and noted that the Plan still had persistent deficits in 2021 and \n2022, leading to a depletion of its reserves. As at 3 1 December 2022, the reserve of \nthe United Nations Medical Insurance Plan totalled $2.66 million, and the ratio of \nreserve balance to average expenses per month was 0.72, which was far below the \nreserve level of six to eight average months of claim costs s et for the plan, as shown \nin table II.22.  \n \n  Table II.22  \n  Reserve levels of the United Nations Medical Insurance Plan, 2018 \u20132022  \n  (Thousands of United States dollars)  \n \n \n 2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  \n      Surplus/(deficit)  (12 257)  (5 167)  (3 628)  (11 937)  (8 543)  \nReserve  31 931  26 763  23 136  11 199  2 657  \nAverage expenses per month  3 797  3 150  3 007  3 833  3 681  \nRatio (reserve/average expenses per month)  8.41  8.50  7.70  2.92  0.72  \n \nSource : Based on data from the ERP Central Component in Umoja.  \n \n \n221. The Administration explained that the United Nations Medical Insurance Plan \npremium rate has been unchanged since 2015. In addition, the Secretariat had been \nplanning to establish a committee that would be responsible for proposing adjustments  \nto prem ium rates to ensure the sustainability of the Plan, and significant progress has \nbeen made. The Administration has gathered the required data and additional \npersonnel are being recruited to evaluate and address all aspects of the Plan.  \n222. The United Nati ons Medical Insurance Plan provides health insurance coverage \nfor more than 50,000 insured persons, and the majority of them reside in the least \ndeveloped countries. The Board is concerned that the continued deterioration of the \nfinancial situation of the Plan as well as the absence of a relevant premium rate \nadjustment mechanism may affect medical reimbursements for participants in the Plan.  \n223. The Board recommends that the Administration establish an institutional \nmechanism for United Nations Medical I nsurance Plan management to \nperiodically review the performance of the Plan, propose premium rate \nadjustments and closely monitor the reserve balance of the Plan to ensure its \nsustainability . \n224.

However, in recent years, \nno similar actions had been taken to address rising reserve balances. Instead, \npremiums for the three plans have increased,  leading to high reserve levels.  \n227.

The Controller has approved the recommended premium holiday, which will \nbe implemented during the upcoming 2023/24 period.  \n228. The Board is of the view that sufficient health insurance reserves are essential \nto the stability of h ealth insurance plans, while a continuous high reserve level over \nseveral years compared with relevant benchmarks may imply that the Organization \nand plan participants bear higher costs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ff04b2d-ae11-4735-ac5e-744f56a81cd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ff04b2d-ae11-4735-ac5e-744f56a81cd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18a866d1-73f6-4578-904a-d3764eb6a2d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "4d31f4971a482b806369e8eb27e9297564a275cb20cdb89edaa3c0063194f3f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01bcb9fa-3a50-4c7b-8ae6-43dddc5b334c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "64", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "06b6ece6fac702315eadbeca69e342abfa1d4b628f1125945d28e1e1da65b3e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9962c243-764c-4580-87b9-7ec86fa0ed63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9004d803eed229d227c370a79723c8296832e5e079f7c10dc9404ff9ce301938", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e290a954da9646a87623df9ba9eba2a9bdd141ced48bcd4bbd65f0e716a632d5", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  63/396 \n 229. The Board recommends that the Administration closely monitor the  reserve \nbalances of the health insurance plans and take appropriate actions in due course \nto ensure the reserve remains within a reasonable range.  \n230. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Lack of documented procedures for formal approv al of newly established reserves of \nthe United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and Accidents  \n \n231. The Statutes of the United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against \nSickness and Accidents provide that the Reserve Fund should  be between 25 and \n50 per cent of the total benefits paid in the past two years. If the Reserve Fund falls \noutside this range, the Executive Committee must amend the situation and receive \napproval from the Director -General of the United Nations Office at G eneva. As shown \nin the financial statements of the United Nations as reported in volume I, the net assets \nof the United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society comprise accumulated surplus \nand reserves. In January 2018, the Director -General of the United Na tions Office at \nGeneva approved a document that specified that the accumulated surplus represented \nthe Reserve Fund as defined by the Statutes, while reserves were divided into four \nseparate balances: (a) a reserve for catastrophic claims; (b) a reserve fo r currency \nfluctuations; (c) a reserve for terminal indemnities; and (d) an actuarial reserve for \nlong -term risks.  \n232. The Board noted that, after the composition of the reserves was approved by the \nDirector -General, a new reserve for non -dependant insure d family members was \nestablished in 2020, initially amounting to $5 million and subsequently increasing to \n$5.7 million. The establishment of this new reserve was not approved by the Director -\nGeneral . \n233. It was explained that the establishment of this ne w reserve was approved by the \nExecutive Committee of the United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society following \nan actuarial study that outlined the rationale for this new reserve as well as the \nmethodology for the calculation of its amount.  \n234. The Boar d is of the view that creation of new reserves may affect the Reserve \nFund (accumulated surplus) level, which may be subject to the approval of the \nDirector -General. Therefore, the Board considers that, taking into account the best \ninterests of the Organiz ation and plan participants, the establishment of new reserves \nshould be approved by the Director -General of the United Nations Office at Geneva.  \n235. The Board recommends that the Administration consider amending the \ninternal rules to require formal appro val from the Director -General of the \nUnited Nations Office at Geneva for the creation of any new reserve of the United \nNations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and Accidents in order \nto strengthen its management of reserves and ensure the Re serve Fund remains \nwithin a reasonable range.   \n236. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (b) Long -outstanding accounts receivable for health insurance funds  \n \n237. According to the information circular on the renewal of the United Nations \nHeadq uarters -administered health insurance programme ( ST/IC/2022/9 ) and the \nStatutes of the United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and \nAccidents, the Uni ted Nations self -funded health insurance plans managed by United \nNations Headquarters and the United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society are open \nto the United Nations system and the cost is shared between the participants and the \nOrganization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9962c243-764c-4580-87b9-7ec86fa0ed63": {"__data__": {"id_": "9962c243-764c-4580-87b9-7ec86fa0ed63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "020af90a-dafb-4af3-8f3b-35bbd17cf862", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "be8b5234d57bf0fa6b2cba5545f5678f9c737e00746e908503dc11ccb680aecb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ff04b2d-ae11-4735-ac5e-744f56a81cd9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "e290a954da9646a87623df9ba9eba2a9bdd141ced48bcd4bbd65f0e716a632d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "edcc3595-a5e4-4647-99c2-0e463d479dfd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "bc978fe92bb5a20de3efecc40ff708acd5f0feec3ab0986de184f55cbf34e747", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9004d803eed229d227c370a79723c8296832e5e079f7c10dc9404ff9ce301938", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n64/396 23-11009  \n 238. As disclosed in note 28 to the financial statements, the United Nations health \ninsurance plans had a total amount of $39.81 million in other receivables as at \n31 December 2022. With regard to the ageing of those related accounts receivable, a \ntotal amount of $15.75 million had been outstanding for more than one year, for which \n$4.67 million in allowances had been provided for those doubtful accounts.  \n239. After a structural analysis of those accounts receivable, the Board noted that the \ntotal amount of $15.37 million in overdue accounts receivable for more than one year \nbelonged to entities participating in Headquarters -administered plans, for which \n$4.47 million in allowances had been provided for those doubtful accounts.  \n240. The Administration explained that  as at 31 December 2022, $24.88 million in \nreceipts ($24.86 million of which was from United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund) \nhad been recorded as a placeholder pending clearance against their related \nreceivables. A detailed reconciliation process needed to be performed in order to \napportion the credit amount across the multiple insurance funds.  \n241. The Board recommends that the Administration expedite the reconciliation \nprocess of accounts receivable to ensure the visibility of actual outstanding \namounts  and continue to urge relevant agencies and entities to pay their share of \ncontributions to the health insurance funds in a timely manner.  \n242. The Board also noted that as at 31 December 2022, the United Nations Staff \nMutual Insurance Society had a total amount of $387,146.91 in overdue accounts \nreceivable for more than one year, which was related to advances to retired and active \nstaff members and to service -incurred accidents.  \n243. The Administration explained that when it paid advances directly to  the medical \nservice providers, it paid 100 per cent of the invoice and sought refunds from the \nretired and active staff members for his or her out -of-pocket share. For those agencies \nnot using Umoja, such as UNICEF, the World Meteorological Organization a nd ITU, \nthe United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society could not process the out -of-\npocket share of the refund through payroll deductions and had to follow up with plan \nparticipants for reimbursements. In addition, the United Nations Staff Mutual \nInsura nce Society advanced some funds to staff members who may have had accidents \nduring the performance of official duties. This was also the cause of long -outstanding \naccounts receivable.  \n244. The Board recommends that the Administration approach the participa ting \norganizations that have not yet implemented recoveries through payroll to \nanalyse the possibility of implementing automated recoveries to improve \nrecoveries and ensure that aged receivables do not have an adverse impact on \nhealth insurance operations.  \n245. The Administration accepted these recommendations.  \n \n 9. Assets management  \n \n246. As disclosed in note 15 to the financial statements, the net book value of \nproperty, plant and equipment of the operations of the United Nations as reported in \nvolume I t otalled $3 billion as at 31 December 2022, representing a 0.8 per cent \nincrease from the prior year\u2019s balance of $2.98 billion.

The Board conducted an on -site physical verification of the heritage property \non a sample basis at United Nations Headquarters and noted that the following issues \nwere in need of improvement.  \n \n (i) Discrepancies between the actual status of heritage items and their records in Umoja  \n \n249. A total of 96 heritage items could not be initially located, while the Umoja \nsystem records showed their status as \u201cin storage\u201d. The Administration subsequently \nexplained that these items were in the custody of the Office of Information and \nCommunications Technology and displayed in the General Assembly Building. The \nUmoja records are to be updated accordingly.  \n250. The Board randomly selected 10 heritage items from the \u201cin storage\u201d list in \nUmoja. Of these, three items were not found. The Administration ex plained that two \nof the items were in shipping containers and the third was in a crate at the North Lawn \nBuilding owing to damage to the gift.  \n251. A newly received gift in 2022 had not been recorded in Umoja. The \nAdministration explained that the record would be uploaded to Umoja by the end of \n2023.  \n \n (ii) Warehouse under the Secretariat building was not in ideal condition for storage of \nheritage items  \n \n252. During the physical verification, the Board noted that the warehouse for heritage \nitems was not eq uipped with special closed -circuit television camera monitoring \nabove the entrance, nor were there cameras in the room. In addition, the room \ncontained a large quantity of other items, such as used furniture and the personal \nproperty of staff members. Furt hermore, the room had no temperature or humidity \ncontrol systems to maintain a stable environment for preservation.  \n253. The Administration explained that enhanced climate control requirements \nwould require further assessment by a professional architect to  identify what could \nbe done. In addition, storage space in the complex was very limited and was \nchallenging to maintain.  \n \n (iii) Some heritage items were not under proper stewardship, or were located in a \nhazardous environment  \n \n254. Three heritage items w ere located in level 3B of the parking garage in the \nSecretariat building, near which were parking lots in daily use. The Administration \nexplained that the garage areas had been affected by water leaks and water infiltration \nover the years which had caused  damage to items stored there. In addition, the three \nitems were too large to be placed in the warehouse.  \n255. For two items not located during physical verification, the Administration \nexplained that they had been moved to shipping containers from garage areas as a \nresult of water leaks and infiltration. The items showed water damage, and any \nattempt to enter the containers would require appropriate personal protective \nequipment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6346da5-dec2-47a2-83fd-2eb9a2a59599": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6346da5-dec2-47a2-83fd-2eb9a2a59599", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "22229c35-2196-4130-8906-cdbf3edc620e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "1c9ba66201f2646bbf78d2870fa7b9d1f50fd4ee0d47c28d763f00bed52d7fa8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "edcc3595-a5e4-4647-99c2-0e463d479dfd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "bc978fe92bb5a20de3efecc40ff708acd5f0feec3ab0986de184f55cbf34e747", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea4c1c09-8fa1-4dd6-8469-a3d7fdaa49fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "3bdbd2528d64df2b24b5e5f0111151d42b00aaa89ae7fc875e96ed59f01468fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3d9edd92fdda0a1e8c6429b8f6b28d5087e8afff8557f5cbd48a130053b91045", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n66/396 23-11009  \n 256. The Board is of the view that heritage property is characterized by its \nirreplaceability, uniqueness and inestimable market price. The general expectation that \nthe property would be indefinitely preserved for cultural purposes for the benefit of \npresent and future generations is very much undermined by improper stewardship. Th e \nproperty may be subject to deterioration and corrosion as a result of long exposure to \nunstable temperatures and humidity in a basement or shipping container. Moreover, \nthe unreconciled discrepancies between system records and the actual status of the \nheritage items may affect the completeness and accuracy of the property records.  \n257. The Board recommends that the Administration develop an overall physical \ninspection plan to identify and ensure the proper preservation of the 96 heritage \nassets in the cus tody of the Office of Information and Communications Technology.  \n258. The Board also recommends that the Administration update relevant data \nin Umoja in a timely manner to ensure the accuracy of heritage property records \nat United Nations Headquarters in the future.   \n259. The Board further recommends that the Administration conduct a \nprofessional assessment of the warehouse\u2019s environment at United Nations \nHeadquarters and take necessary measures to ensure the safe storage of heritage \nassets.  \n260. The Administration accepted these recommendations.  \n \n (b) Deficiencies in Africa Hall renovation project management leading to \n$3.69  million in losses and a 42 -month delay  \n \n261. The need to rejuvenate Africa Hall was identified by the Member States in 2008, \non the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of ECA. ECA completed the feasibility \nstudy and the concept design for the Africa Hall renovation project in 2014. In 2016, \nthe Gene ral Assembly approved the renovation project in its resolution 70/248  A, \nentrusting ECA with the implementation of the project. The cost of the project was \nestimated at $56 .9 million. As at 31 December 2022, a total budget of $36.54 million \nhad been approved for Africa Hall renovation project activities.  \n262. The Board noted some deficiencies in the management of this project, set out \nbelow.  \n \n (i) Non-compliance issue in co ntract procurement process  \n \n263. The Procurement Manual provides that vendors that are not registered at the basic \nlevel in the United Nations Global Marketplace or have been suspended, even if they \nare in the process of reinstatement, should not be invite d to participate in solicitation \nexercises or be eligible to receive bid materials. Vendors must be registered at the \nappropriate level in the Global Marketplace to be considered for award.  \n264. The Procurement Manual also provides that if the award amoun t is greater than \n$0.5 million, a level 2 registration is mandatory. To register at level 2, vendors must \nundergo a thorough financial review and submit audited or certified financial \nstatements for the previous three financial cycles for evaluation. The V endor \nRegistration Officer evaluates the financial status of vendors using established criteria \nand if a vendor fails to provide the required financial data it will not be able to register \nat level 2.  \n265. The Board reviewed the first contract procurement process for the Africa Hall \nrenovation project and noted that the project was initially expected to be completed in \nDecember 2021, at a total cost of $28.2 million. Therefore, in accordance with the \ncriteria, the selected contractor for the project should have been a qualified level -2 \nvendor .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea4c1c09-8fa1-4dd6-8469-a3d7fdaa49fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea4c1c09-8fa1-4dd6-8469-a3d7fdaa49fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5b75881-e8d6-43f0-9b8d-cb4a1cf1f46b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "072afba16de8b2cb239c4e901531a96d419dad6a2e6cda27996fbc34f8a71724", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6346da5-dec2-47a2-83fd-2eb9a2a59599", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "3d9edd92fdda0a1e8c6429b8f6b28d5087e8afff8557f5cbd48a130053b91045", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2322a451-b4a8-4755-99cc-59264b8c6938", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "53380c0655a2448c886da9f86fa12feb8224db4fc4094cd9ab7f5b9fcf1f0bcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3bdbd2528d64df2b24b5e5f0111151d42b00aaa89ae7fc875e96ed59f01468fc", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  67/396 \n 266. However, the Board noted that the first contract for this project was awarded to \na newly registered joint venture on 10 May 2019 that had been registered in one \ncountry just three months prior, on 18 February 2019 . The joint venture may not have \nmet the criterion for the submission of audited or certified financial statements for the \nprevious three financial cycles at the time of the award. The Board also noted that the \nHeadquarters Committee on Contracts approved the case submission on 9 January \n2019, with the contingency that the joint venture be properly registered.  \n267. The Administration explained that all three companies comprising the planned \njoint venture had been registered separately at level 2 prior to t he presentation of the \ncase to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts. Some joint -venture companies, \nparticularly in construction cases, were typically registered after they were notified \nof an award. However, by the time of the audit in April 2023, the A dministration had \nnot provided the Board with the required files of the joint venture's registration as a \nlevel -2 vendor.  \n268. The Board is concerned that ECA may have awarded the project before the joint \nventure became a qualified level -2 vendor, which is  not fully in compliance with the \nrequirements set out in the Procurement Manual.  \n \n (ii) Failure to terminate contract promptly when obligations cannot be fulfilled by \nthe contractor  \n \n269. The General Assembly, in its resolution 74/263 , emphasized that the Global \nAsset Management Policy Service of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy \nand Compliance should continue to be actively involved in overseeing the Africa H all \nproject to ensure the central supervision of capital projects, including risk \nmanagement and alignment with lessons learned.  \n270. The request for proposal for the main renovation works of the Africa Hall project \nrequires the contractor to provide a per formance security in the form of an \nindependent bank guarantee or a similar acceptable guarantee to the United Nations, \nequal to 10 per cent of the contract price, within 14 calendar days of the signature of \na contract or issuance of a purchase order.  \n271. The contract for the renovation and refurbishment of Africa Hall between the \nUnited Nations and the contractor specifies that the contractor must deliver the bank \nguarantee for performance to the employer within 14 days after the date of the \ncontract. If the contractor fails to comply with the bank guarantee for performance \nclause, the employer can terminate the contract and expel the contractor from the site \nafter giving 14 days\u2019 notice to the contractor. However, if the contractor becomes \nbankrupt, insol vent or goes into liquidation, the employer can terminate the contract \nimmediately upon notice.  \n272. The Board was informed that the contractor (the above -mentioned joint venture) \nhad submitted a bank guarantee for performance that had been rejected by the  \nAdministration for not meeting the criteria. Ultimately, the contractor did not \nsuccessfully deliver a bank guarantee for performance within the required 14 days, \nleading to their failure to fulfil contractual obligations. Furthermore, the lead \ncompany in  the joint venture declared bankruptcy in October 2019, and withdrew \nfrom the joint venture agreement. As a result, the remaining two companies were \nunable to meet the contract\u2019s terms, leading ECA to terminate the contract in February \n2020, nine months af ter the default.  \n273. The Board is of the view that terminating a contract promptly when it cannot be \nfulfilled may help prevent further losses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2322a451-b4a8-4755-99cc-59264b8c6938": {"__data__": {"id_": "2322a451-b4a8-4755-99cc-59264b8c6938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4d12fe4-b46a-40ea-9c39-81a3492cae29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "aea2a9a2fab845e140c5e8a955d475cd24788c4bc64bf8889940d98245c9cef9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea4c1c09-8fa1-4dd6-8469-a3d7fdaa49fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "3bdbd2528d64df2b24b5e5f0111151d42b00aaa89ae7fc875e96ed59f01468fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a86c7b6-ebb1-480e-a618-5c6dd0359af8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "c66919dfbd37371b79f739a84827a90480ccbe34cd63af1775c4c551cae8e2c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "53380c0655a2448c886da9f86fa12feb8224db4fc4094cd9ab7f5b9fcf1f0bcd", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n68/396 23-11009  \n  (iii) Lack of action on joint venture\u2019s liability for contract termination costs  \n \n274. As set out in article 14.6 of the United Nations General Conditions of Contract \nfor the provision of goods and services, except as prohibited by law, the contractor is \nrequired to compensate the United Nations for all damages and costs, including, but \nnot limited to, all costs incurred by the United Nations in any legal or non -legal \nproceedings, as a result of any of the events specified in article 14.5, and resulting \nfrom or relating to a termination of the contract, even if the contractor is adjudged \nbank rupt, or is granted a moratorium or stay or is declared insolvent.  \n275. The contract for the renovation and refurbishment of Africa Hall provides that \nif the employer considers itself to be entitled to any payment under any clause of \nthese conditions or o therwise in connection with the contract, and/or to any extension \nof the defects notification period, the employer should give a claim notice stating that \nit is a notice pursuant to subclause 20.2, and submit particulars to the contractor.  \n276. The Adminis tration explained that ECA sought legal advice from the Office of \nLegal Affairs regarding the contractual rights of the United Nations and a financial \nrisk assessment. In July 2022, ECA provided an estimated resolicitation cost of \n$3.69  million owing to co ntract termination. In 2023, ECA began engaging with \nparties to the joint venture, holding meetings and exchanging correspondence. On \n2 March 2023, ECA met with two of the three joint venture parties to discuss \nreimbursing the United Nations for costs resu lting from the contractor\u2019s failure. Later, \nECA sent a letter to the joint venture parties and received a response from one of the \nthree parties on May 2023.  \n277. The Board was informed that the joint venture entity itself no longer existed and \nthat one of  the three companies constituting the joint venture was in bankruptcy \nproceedings, another had been liquidated and the third had been nonresponsive to the \nrecent correspondence from ECA. In addition, pursuing a claim against a financially \ndistressed contra ctor could incur substantial costs for the Organization and, as a \nresult, a thorough cost -benefit analysis would need to be conducted to determine the \nviability of pursuing a claim.  \n278. The Board is of the view that taking prompt action to conduct a thor ough \nevaluation of available options, in order to devise an effective and efficient strategy, \ncan maximize the potential for recovering losses and minimizing waste.  \n279. Following the termination by ECA of the main renovation works contract in \nFebruary 202 0, the resolicitation process began in March 2020. It took some 29 \nmonths before the new contract was awarded in August 2022 and the project was \nrescheduled for completion in July 2024, which was 42 months later than the \napproved project timeline.  \n280. The Board is concerned that this delay may result in increased project \nexpenditure and a risk that the project may not be completed within the budget \napproved by the General Assembly.  \n281. The Board recommends that the Administration conduct a thorough revie w \nof the procurement process for this case to ensure full compliance with relevant \nregulations.  \n282. The Board also recommends that the Administration continue its efforts to \nimplement adequate and effective management, as well as strengthen \ncommunication with contractors and stakeholders to ensure completion within \nthe updated project schedule.  \n283. The Board further recommends that the Administration diligently assess \npotential strategies for recovering losses and minimizing inefficiencies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a86c7b6-ebb1-480e-a618-5c6dd0359af8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a86c7b6-ebb1-480e-a618-5c6dd0359af8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "45abb7f1-83ed-4696-8de8-0bc1b9d8e799", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "4970a7aadcdf9f1cdb0803f8e5d10d2fee9a08f1e6ac14bd6bb6202d3dcb85c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2322a451-b4a8-4755-99cc-59264b8c6938", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "53380c0655a2448c886da9f86fa12feb8224db4fc4094cd9ab7f5b9fcf1f0bcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4902cf98-a254-47f6-b612-e450f0f76c97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "33c6e58623bfa3641fa55a74e06d844cab828587ec95c4b5e338a37ce68a6854", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c66919dfbd37371b79f739a84827a90480ccbe34cd63af1775c4c551cae8e2c0", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  69/396 \n 284. The Admin istration accepted these recommendations.  \n \n (c) Delay in implementation of the A to J replacement project at the \nUnited  Nations Office at Nairobi  \n \n285. The General Assembly, in its resolution 72/262  A, approved the project to \nreplace the A to J blocks of the United Nations Office at Nairobi complex. In its \nresolution 76/246  A, the Assembly approved the overall full scope, maximum overall \ncost of $66,260,100 and implementation strategy of the project, with a revised \nschedule that would see substantial project completion by the end of 2024 and final \ncompletion by the end of 2025.  \n286. Also in  resolution 76/242  A, the General Assembly requested the Secretary -\nGeneral to closely monitor and mitigate all project risks and take all measures \nnecessary to ensure the delivery of the project within the scope, budget and timeline, \nas ap proved by the Assembly, and also requested the Secretary -General to include \ninformation on risk management and mitigation measures taken in his next progress \nreport.  \n287. The Board noted that, by the end of April 2023, all three components (early \nworks, fl exible workplace strategies and the new building) had experienced slippage. \nFor the new building component, according to the revised schedule in the fifth \nprogress report on the replacement of the office blocks ( A/77/349  and \nA/77/349/Corr.1 ), the tender phase should have begun in November 2022 and been \ncompleted by 28 February 2023. However,  the actual request for proposal was sent \non 6 March 2023 and the closing of proposals was on 17 April 2023.  \n288. As to the tender evaluation, the Board reviewed the previous seven tenders of \nthe A to J subprojects and noted that all of them had experience d a lengthy process \nwith regard to bidder evaluation, ranging from 63 to 203 days. The Board further \nnoted that, even with the expectation that the contract for the construction of the new \nbuilding would be awarded by the end of June 2023 at the earliest, that would leave \njust 18 months for construction in order to maintain the schedule.  \n289. With regard to the contract implementation phase, the Board noted that all seven \nprevious A to J subprojects experienced a lag in contract execution, which increased \nthe risk that the construction of the new building would not be completed by the target \ndate.  \n290. In his fifth progress report on the project, although the Secretary -General stated \nthat the slippage of the tendering of the new building would have no impact  on the \ncompletion of the building by the end of 2024, he recognized the schedule risk as the \nfourth of the top five risks in a cost sensitivity analysis, while in his fourth progress \nreport ( A/76/330 ), the schedule risk was shown as the fifth of the top five risks that \ncould have the greatest impact on the project.  \n291. The Administration explained that the project had faced significant challenges \nover the past few years, suc h as the COVID -19 pandemic and supply chain issues, \namong others; however, in his progress reports, the Secretary -General had considered \nthe schedule risk as one part of the entire risk profile. In addition, the risk management \napproach accepted by the Gen eral Assembly also recognized the continually improved \nlikelihood of delivering the project within the estimated project cost, even taking into \naccount the risk of some minor project slippage.  \n292. The Board is concerned that, given the delays in the tende ring phase of the new \noffice building, the long times taken for tender evaluations and the past delays in \ncontract implementation, the project to replace office blocks A to J may face a greater \nrisk of delayed delivery than expected.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4902cf98-a254-47f6-b612-e450f0f76c97": {"__data__": {"id_": "4902cf98-a254-47f6-b612-e450f0f76c97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05a0be52-20df-49eb-923d-7cbc763ac839", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "5b1b045a0cc62024a77fecbfa4775fbc1a7b0fed8bf85da4b91b5886070b3c52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a86c7b6-ebb1-480e-a618-5c6dd0359af8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "c66919dfbd37371b79f739a84827a90480ccbe34cd63af1775c4c551cae8e2c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50610377-f2fe-4082-93aa-a1b9a1d8d3f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "30c981fb9ba698975a6f9b3e085ca03bb7537c886ad24b01af74a5bffd8443c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "33c6e58623bfa3641fa55a74e06d844cab828587ec95c4b5e338a37ce68a6854", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n70/396 23-11009  \n 293.

The Administration accepted the rec ommendation.  \n \n (d) Strategic heritage plan  \n \n295. The purpose of the strategic heritage plan of the United Nations Office at \nGeneva is to renovate the Palais des Nations, establish a new building to meet the \nrequirements of the Organization and address heal th, safety and working conditions. \nThe Palais des Nations is the largest United Nations conference centre in Europe.  \n296. In its resolution 68/247  A, the General Assembly stressed the importance of \noversight with respect to the development and implementation of the strategic \nheritage plan and requested the Advisory Committee on Administrative and \nBudgetary Questions to request the Board of Auditors to provide oversight assu rance \nand to report annually on that matter to the Assembly. In response, on 27 August 2014, \nthe Chair of the Board confirmed that the Board would audit and report on the \nstrategic heritage plan.  \n \n  Delayed completion date  \n \n297. The expected completion of the works, initially approved in 2015 to be ended \nin 2023, has been extended to December 2025, according to the strategic heritage plan \nteam. Actual completion might potentially take until July 2026, according to an \nindependent risk analysis. These delays are due in part to external events (including \nthe COVID -19 pandemic and material and labour shortages) but also to the many \nchanges made to the project as well as to protracted delays in change management \nprocesses.  \n298. This delay necessitates an extensi on of the audit work of the Board. Currently, \nthe Board has agreed to submit its final report in 2024 ( A/73/157 , para. 4). An \nextension allowing for the submission of a separat e audit report in 2026 appears \nnecessary to comply with resolution 68/247  A of the General Assembly.  \n \n  Overall cost controlled so far  \n \n299. While the overall approved bud get amounts to SwF 836.5 million, the \nexpenditures as at 31 December 2022 amount to SwF 496.2 million (disbursements \nand commitments), or 59 per cent of the approved budget. The strategic heritage plan \nteam currently forecasts an eventual overspend of appr oximately 3 per cent of the \napproved budget.  \n \n  Main outstanding matters  \n \n300. For the newly constructed building H, the outstanding items (\u201cpunch list\u201d) are \nnot all closed, while the two -year liability period for defects began on 4 October 2021; \nsome im portant items, namely concerning technical systems, remain open.  \n301. With regard to the historic buildings, works are still ongoing owing to the \nnumerous changes that have occurred.  \n302.

Owing to changes in working habits (i.e. remote work stemming from the \nCOVID -19 pandemic), the average rate of occupancy at the United Nations Office at \nGeneva as a whole is low, including in building H. This situation is a matter of \nconcern, considering that two a dditional buildings are still being leased in Geneva at \nsignificant cost, notably for OHCHR, which is due to move into building H at the \ncompletion of strategic heritage plan. In this regard, the early transitional plan and, \nmore generally, the current rat io of eight desks for 10 people, do not appear relevant \nand raise issues regarding the efficiency of space occupancy.  \n \n  Preservation of heritage  \n \n304. Regarding questions related to the preservation of heritage, some pieces of \nfurniture would benefit from  a renovation. While most of the works of art and \nfurniture are located in temporary storage in good conditions, the works of art located \nin the existing vault of the library of the United Nations Office at Geneva, which has \nyet to be renovated, do not ben efit from good and safe conditions of conservation.  \n305. The Board recommends that the Administration assess whether there is \npotential for recouping any avoidable costs that may have arisen, and closely \nmonitor the technical steps of the programme in orde r to anticipate and prevent \nchanges resulting from the mistakes or shortcomings of its vendors.  \n306. The Board recommends that the Administration design an alternative plan \nto ensure OHCHR moves in on schedule even in the event the works on building  E \nare delayed.  \n307. The Board recommends that the Administration resolve all pending issues \nfor building H before the end of the liability period.  \n308. The Board recommends that the Administration conduct a space optimization \nstudy by the end of 2023 and take st eps to significantly increase the occupancy rate \nof the United Nations Office at Geneva premises, including building H.  \n309. The Administration accepted the recommendations.  \n \n 10. Human resources management  \n \n310. In its report on financial reports and audi ted financial statements, and reports of \nthe Board of Auditors for the period ended 31 December 2021, the Advisory \nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions raised concerns about the use \nof personnel recruited through UNDP, UNOPS and third -party service providers, and \nstressed the need for greater clarity, compliance with the relevant rules and \nregulations, as well as budgetary transparency for outsourcing the recruitment of \npersonnel to UNDP, UNOPS and third parties ( A/77/574 , para. 53).  \n311. The Advisory Committee also expressed serious concern that the concurrence of \nthe Committee, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 35/217 , was not sought prior \nto the establishment of a number of high -level positions funded through extrabudgetary \nsources, and recommended that the Assembly request the Secretary -General to take all \nmeasures necessa ry to avoid the repetition of a similar situation and to ensure full \nrespect of the provisions of Assembly resolutions ( A/77/574 , para. 60).  \n312.

The Board followed up on those concerns and reviewed, inter alia, the \nemployment of personnel through UNOPS, UNDP and third -party service providers, \nthe establishment of high -level positions, th e use of temporary appointments and \nspecial post allowances, and geographical distribution and identified deficiencies in \nneed of improvement, as presented below.  \n \n (a) Weaknesses in position management and selection process for staff members \ncontracted by the United Nations Development Programme  \n \n314. In its previous report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap.

The Board followed up on the use of staff members contracted by UNDP and \nnoted that as at 31 December 2022, there were 1,398 staff members contracted by \nUNDP, distributed among five entities of the United Nations as reported in volume I. \nThe Board reviewed the position management, recruitment process and contract \nmanagement thereof and noted the deficiencies set out below.  \n \n (i) Governance of 10 positio ns at the D -1 level and above needs to be improved  \n \n316. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established 11 \npositions at the D -1 level and above in 2022, the resources for which consisted of a \nlump sum under the budget class of grants a nd contributions. These positions were \nfunded by extrabudgetary resources through service -level agreements with UNDP. \nThese 11 positions were for regional humanitarian coordinators and deputy \nhumanitarian coordinators, and 11 positions were filled.  \n317. Among the 11 positions, 10 positions, including 2 Assistant Secretary -General \npositions, 5 D -2 positions and 3 D -1 positions, had been established for more than \none year, with the oldest (Regional Humanitarian Coordinator) having been \nestablished in 2012. Th e Board noted that approval from the appropriate bodies for \nthe 10 positions had not been sought prior to their establishment.  \n318. The Administration explained that the mandate for these senior humanitarian \ncoordinator positions was under the Inter -Agency  Standing Committee. The positions \nwere not part of the Secretariat and held no Secretariat functions. The Administration \nalso explained that three positions had been discontinued as at 31 December 2022 and \nfour positions would be discontinued in 2023.  \n319. The Board is of the view that these 10 positions were actually funded by \nextrabudgetary resources and substantively reported to the Emergency Relief \nCoordinator, who is also the Under -Secretary -General for Humanitarian Affairs. \nThus, the positions shoul d have been approved by the governing bodies.  \n \n (ii) Lack of clarity on the selection procedure for regional humanitarian coordinators \nand deputy humanitarian coordinators  \n \n320.

The Administration e xplained that the regional humanitarian coordinator and \ndeputy humanitarian coordinator positions were not part of the United Nations \nSecretariat, and therefore the administrative instructions on the administration of \ntemporary appointments ( ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1 ) and on the staff selection system \n(ST/AI/2010/3 ) did not apply. According to the existing selection procedure and in \naccordance with General Assembly resolution 46/182 , the Emergency Relief \nCoordinator, after consultation with the Inter -Agency St anding Committee and \npartners, would decide to designate a senior official to a specific country in crisis. \nThen the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs would submit the \nrequest to UNDP to handle the administrative procedures. The Office fo r the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs would work with UNDP to enhance the \nselection procedures for those positions.  \n322. The Board noted that there was no clear policy on the selection procedures for the \npositions of regional humanitarian coordinator and deputy humanitarian coordinator.  \n323. The Board is concerned that the lack of a clear policy and clarity on the selection \nprocedure may have an impact on the consistency, competitiveness and transparency \nof the selection process.  \n324. The Board recomm ends that the Administration ensure that the Office for \nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs enhance the governance of those high -\nlevel positions, in collaboration with the Inter -Agency Standing Committee and \nUNDP, to ensure they are under adequate sup ervision.  \n325. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Lack of review by the Secretariat central review bodies in the selection process for \nnational staff administered by the United Nations Development Programme on behalf \nof the Secretariat  \n \n326. The central review bodies play a crucial role in ensuring that the best candidate \nis selected for each position, as they ensure compliance with United Nations \nregulations, promote fairness and non -discrimination, evaluate candidates objec tively, \nenhance consistency in decision -making and ensure quality of employment.  \n327. On a sample basis, the Board reviewed the selection process for national staff \nadministered by UNDP on behalf of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs. The Board noted that there no review process had been conducted by the \nSecretariat central review bodies during the selection process of 1,174 candidates, \nwhich was required in the staff selection system.  \n328. The Administration explained that national st aff were selected through a \ncompetitive process in accordance with UNDP policies on recruitment and were \nsubject to a compliance review by the UNDP compliance review panel, which was \nsimilar to the central review body mechanism.  \n329. The Board is of the v iew that the United Nations Secretariat central review body \nmechanism plays a key role in making sure the evaluation criteria have been properly \napplied and the applicable procedures have been thoroughly followed. Furthermore, \nthe lack of review by central  review bodies may result in disputes when staff are \ntransferred back to the Secretariat.  \n330. The Board recommends that the Administration continue to support \nentities in expediting the process of integrating UNDP -administered staff into the \nSecretariat in a progressive and seamless manner with due regard to ensuring \ntransparency and fairness of the selection process, in accordance with the \nOrganization\u2019s regulatory framework.  \n331.

Details \nare shown in tabl e II.28.  \n \n  Table II.28  \n  Duration analysis for personnel contracted by company T as at 31 December 2022  \n \n \nDuration  Number of personnel  \n  More than 15 years  37 \n10 to 15 years  108 \n5 to 10 years  330 \n3 to 5 years  184 \n1 to 3 years  354 \nLess than 1 year  293 \n Total  1 306  \n \nSource : Based on data provided by the Office of Information and Communications Technology.  \n \n \n337. The Board then reviewed the functional titles of those contracted personnel and \nnoted that core or regular functions (such as information technology infrastructure \ntechnician, data architect and web designer), which could have been held by \nSecretariat staf f funded by the regular budget, had been performed by contracted \npersonnel for a long time.  \n338. That contractors work for the Secretariat for long periods of time is concerning \nto the Board, as it may be indicative of their being an integral part of the workforce \nat the relevant entities, and their performance of core or regular functions may pose \nrisks to data security and confidentiality and lead to a lack of institutional knowledge \nand a reduction in accountability, among other things.  \n339. The Board recommends that the Administration conduct a thorough \nworkforce review of the ICT staffing support service and avoid overreliance on \nthird -party contract personnel.   \n340. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Deficiencies in procurement a nd contract management  \n \n341. The Board reviewed the procurement and contract management relating to the \nICT staffing support service and noted the following significant deficiencies therein.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22e1dbd3-38d3-402b-b3c2-97f1a106ac88": {"__data__": {"id_": "22e1dbd3-38d3-402b-b3c2-97f1a106ac88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54fc722d-9c31-4140-8e36-1a92c0a16948", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "997d6b2eee0a5c6398619b74b89388d7e87c5aec79081fe9f8b48c7b650886fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d893c37-7e07-4abf-a8ec-bb43e324eec0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "699b50b39e4646ae39d2e506e843cb6c0447b92951b0fb7cb4f0d471983576a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bfc2c7e0-8581-44d1-aa7c-0cecf4e38e07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "717e572f1a7965b7fe3721620e370840683e28360c680e1f0407111f0dfffa04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8bd277d71a84dc66e54fa1cbb31442628a8dbeffa4f6996a7dff186137efeb81", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n76/396 23-11009  \n   (a) Company T did not meet the initial mandatory criteria for pre-qualification but \nwas awarded the contract  \n \n342. The Board reviewed the procurement process for ICT staffing support services \nconducted by the Procurement Division in 2004 and noted some significant \ndeficiencies.  \n343. In February 2004, the Procurement Division issued a request for information to \n401 vendors indicating the mandatory pre -qualification criteria to be eligible for the \nrequest -for-proposal phase of the solicitation exercise. Of the 17 vendors that \nresponded, 2 were disqualified for not meeti ng the mandatory requirements. However, \nthe Procurement Division did not disqualify company T, which was eventually \nawarded the contract even though it had not met the initial mandatory criteria for \npre-qualification with regard to profit and turnover indi cators. Furthermore, in the \nevaluation report on vendors that responded to the request for information, the \nProcurement Division revised the evaluation criterion from \u201cprofitability of the \nvendor in the last three years\u201d to a less stringent requirement of \u201csubmission of \nfinancial statements\u201d and reduced the annual turnover criterion from $10 million to \n$5 million. As a result of those changes, company T finally pre -qualified for the \nrequest -for-proposal phase. The reasons for changing the mandatory pre -qualification \ncriteria were not documented and the Procurement Division could not provide \nexplanations owing to the passage of time and staff turnover.  \n344. The Board is of the view that the Procurement Division needs to ensure that, \nwhere changes are require d with regard to vendor pre -qualification requirements, \nsuch changes are properly documented, duly approved and applied to all bidders as \nstated in the Procurement Manual. Violations of those requirements may result in \nnon-compliance and a lack of fairness  and transparency, which pose reputational risks \nto the Organization.  \n \n  (b) Insufficient planning for solicitation resulted in missed opportunities and \nexisting contracts were not replaced as envisaged  \n \n345. The original contract with company T was signe d on 30 June 2005; since then \nit has undergone 36 amendments. The Administration had planned to conduct a \nsolicitation to replace the contract; however, the planned solicitation was repeatedly \ndelayed owing to insufficient planning and delays in developing  the statement of \nwork, as set out below.  \n346. The duration for the original contract with company T was for an initial period \nof three years, with the United Nations having the right to extend the contract for an \nadditional one or two years (i.e. a \u201c3+1+1\u201d contract), with a total not -to-exceed \namount of $66.51 million, which should have ended on 30 June 2010. However, the \nBoard noted that the solicitation was not conducted until 2011 owing to insufficient \nplanning and delays in developing the stateme nt of work. This then resulted in the \noriginal contract being extended twice, to 30 June 2012, with the not -to-exceed \namount increasing to $170.53 million. The extension was requested by the \nProcurement Division as there was no firm date for when a new sol icitation would be \nissued and because these services were of critical importance to mission operations.  \n347. The Board further noted that the second solicitation was conducted in February \n2017, due mainly to the fact that developing the statement of work h ad taken nearly \nfive years. Between the two solicitations, the contract had been extended twice, to \n30 June 2017, with the not -to-exceed amount increasing to $396.04 million.  \n348. The Administration explained that the creation of the statement of work was a \ntime -consuming and highly consultative process. There were issues with the \ninterpretation of the contract relating to travel, visas, entitlements and evacuation,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfc2c7e0-8581-44d1-aa7c-0cecf4e38e07": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfc2c7e0-8581-44d1-aa7c-0cecf4e38e07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "012064c5-a4ed-46c6-8d8e-ee33c9846458", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "6b3cb7002ddf71632a514373ffa54780ad1284167215df341ac949134a54c7e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22e1dbd3-38d3-402b-b3c2-97f1a106ac88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "8bd277d71a84dc66e54fa1cbb31442628a8dbeffa4f6996a7dff186137efeb81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed41f66f-ecd1-4fc1-bcc6-1a5973c74f12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "d614b470676a90307cc1a8a04c3e7bc9605ab38315e0e85315addef346b6e2cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "717e572f1a7965b7fe3721620e370840683e28360c680e1f0407111f0dfffa04", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  77/396 \n which resulted in the delay for the first solicitation. The Administration further \nexplained  that developing a completely new structure of services that shifted from \nstaff augmentation to performance -based services also took time.  \n349. The Headquarters Committee on Contracts repeatedly expressed serious \nconcerns over the length of time it had tak en for the replacement solicitation to move \nforward, and requested that the Procurement Division accelerate the process of the \npreparing the statement of work.  \n350. While acknowledging the complexity of the new solicitation, the Board is of the \nview that t he Procurement Division and the Department of Field Support (now the \nDepartment of Operational Support) had been aware of the challenges for many years \nand could have started the process much earlier. The Board is also of the view that \nthe Department of Fi eld Support should have prioritized expediting the replacement \nprocess of the existing contract to avoid putting itself in a situation where it had no \nother choice than to extend the contract once again, especially considering that the \noriginal not -to-exce ed amount of the contract with company T of more than \n$66 million has now exceeded $1 billion.  \n351. The Board is concerned that the recurrent insufficient planning and significant \nbacklogs in solicitation resulted in the lack of achievement of the envisage d results \nwith regard to replacing the existing contract and in a waste of resources.  \n \n  (c) Weaknesses in solicitation and a lack of fairness and transparency therein  \n \n352. The Board reviewed a solicitation process conducted in 2017 and noted \nweaknesses. On 19 February 2017, the Procurement Division issued a request for \nproposal to 134 vendors from 30 countries for the provision of various ICT services. \nCompany \u201cM\u201d received the highest technical score and had the lowest cost. In its \nconsideration, the Head quarters Committee on Contracts examined whether \ncompany  \u201cA\u201d which, together with company M, formed a consortium, was an eligible \nbidder. At last, the Procurement Division, together with the requisitioner, determined \nthat the reinstatement of company A mad e it eligible for a contract award as a member \nof the consortium led by company M. However, the Assistant Secretary -General for \nSupply Chain Management did not accept the recommendation to award the contract, \nas presented by the Procurement Division and su pported by the majority of the \nCommittee members, but rather accepted a recommendation to reject and rebid. In \naddition, the Procurement Division communicated with company T regarding the \ncancellation of the original solicitation and invited company T to p articipate in \nnegotiations to provide the services for a period of two years.  \n353. The Board is of the view: (a) that the consortium led by company M was \ndeprived of the opportunity for negotiations and the award of the contract, even \nthough it was technic ally compliant and the lowest in price, without sufficient \ndocumented justifications, may be indicative of deficiencies in the procurement \nprocess, and that the award of the contract to company T did not meet the principles \nof fairness, integrity and trans parency and was not in the best interests of the \nOrganization; and (b) that the negotiated reduced price of company T was still higher \nthan that of the consortium led by company M, which may have resulted in the \ndeprivation of the Organization of the oppor tunity to reduce costs when obtaining ICT \nstaffing support services.  \n354. The Board is deeply concerned about weaknesses that were identified in the \ncourse of previous solicitations in 2005 and 2017, which go against the principle of \nbest economic efficie ncy and may affect the reputation of the United Nations. Given \nthe Secretariat\u2019s heavy reliance on ICT staffing personnel contracted by third parties, \nas well as the deficiencies identified in the procurement and contract management \nprocesses, it is necess ary to conduct a comprehensive review of these procurement", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed41f66f-ecd1-4fc1-bcc6-1a5973c74f12": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed41f66f-ecd1-4fc1-bcc6-1a5973c74f12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9e1133f6-8015-49f0-baef-32a2b2bef0d6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "675e674dc32bc28a65661b4bcc0eafa33f24a2aee17fb6f168566932f41faf76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfc2c7e0-8581-44d1-aa7c-0cecf4e38e07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "717e572f1a7965b7fe3721620e370840683e28360c680e1f0407111f0dfffa04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "729233f6-fe7f-4072-8434-01b72fb9936e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "1fbf51d123256948750c2ec774fd85a57ce6f1ff2ee2417452b5d8615765254d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d614b470676a90307cc1a8a04c3e7bc9605ab38315e0e85315addef346b6e2cd", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n78/396 23-11009  \n process and an assessment needs to be conducted on the current modality with regard \nto its cost -effectiveness.  \n355. The Board recommends that the Administration review procurement issues \nthat aros e from previous solicitations to ensure lessons learned are incorporated \ninto the new procurement process for the same requirements to ensure that the \nprocess is in accordance with United Nations procurement principles.  \n356. The Administration accepted the  recommendation.  \n \n (c) Significant deficiencies in the management and selection process of a P -5 position  \n \n357. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs established a position at \nthe P -5 level for the construction of a website for the Securit y Council, and selected \na candidate to take up the position in 2018 for a three -month period, but did not issue \na temporary job opening.  \n358. The Board identified the following significant deficiencies in the management \nand selection process for the posit ion: (a) the main function of the position was to \nupdate a Security Council website, which is commonly done by a consultant if \nin-house expertise cannot be found, and is not aligned with the title of Senior \nProgramme Officer (P -5); (b) the establishment of  the position was not duly approved; \n(c) the person selected had been contracted by UNOPS as a strategic communications \nconsultant, and was then selected through a temporary appointment process without \nmeeting the requirement of a break in service of six m onths, as stipulated in \nST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1 ; and (d) there was a possible conflict of interest.  \n359. The Board recommends that the Administration conduct a review of the \nmanagement and selection process for the P -5 position, including to determine \nany deficiencies that may have occurred and whether there was a risk of a \nconflict of interest, and consider any further appropriate administrative action \nfollowing  the results of this review.  \n360. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (d) Position management  \n \n (i) Special post allowance management  \n \n361. In the administrative instruction on special post allowance ( ST/AI/1999/17 ), it \nis stated that the payment of a non -pensionable special post allowance is authorized \nin exceptional cases when a staff member is called upon to assume th e full duties and \nresponsibilities of a post which is clearly recognizable at a higher level than his or \nher own for a temporary period exceeding three months. The General Assembly, in \nparagraph 15 of its resolution 75/252 , noted that the granting of such benefits should \nbe restricted to exceptional cases only and requested the Secretary -General to comply \nwith the rules governing the duration and extension of special post a llowances and \nreview the existence of posts that had been vacant or encumbered through special post \nallowances for more than one year and to report thereon in his next budget proposal.  \n362. In 2022, 1,081 staff members in entities of the United Nations as  reported in \nvolume I had been in receipt of special post allowance.

Among the 488 positions encumbered by \nstaff in receipt of special post allowance, 199 were fully vacant positions. The Board \nnoted that 78 of the 199 positions had been vacant for more than two years.  \n363. The Board is concerned that the provision of special post allowances for more \nthan one year is  not in line with the temporary nature of special post allowances. In \naddition, the use of long -term special post allowances will have a negative impact on \nbusiness continuity and mandate delivery. The Board is of the view that more clarity \nis needed with regard to reporting the use of special post allowance for scrutiny and \nreview by the governing bodies.  \n364. The Board recommends that the Administration review the policy on \nspecial post allowance to ensure that it is only applicable to exceptional cases.  \n365. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (ii) Review needed for classification of four general temporary assistance \nreplacement  positions  \n \n366. The General Assembly, in its resolution 62/236 , recalled its resolution 35/217  \nof 17 December 1980, reaffirmed the role of the Assembly with regard to the structure \nof the Secretariat, including the creation, conversion, suppression and redeployment \nof posts, and requested the Secretary -General to continue to provide the Assembly \nwith comprehensive information on all decisions involving established and temporary \nhigh -level posts, includi ng equivalent positions financed from the regular budget and \nfrom extrabudgetary resources.  \n367. As at 31 December 2022, there were 454 positions at the D -1 level and above \nwith a duration of over one year funded by the regular budget of the United Nations  \nas reported in volume I. Among those positions, 416 were established posts, 23 were \ngeneral temporary assistance replacement positions, 7 were temporary posts, 5 were \nposts funded by voluntary contributions and 3 were positions providing temporary \nassista nce for meetings.  \n368. The Board reviewed those positions and noted that four general temporary \nassistance replacement positions at the D -1 level and above, funded by the regular \nbudget at ECA, were not reported in the proposed programme budget for 2022. The \nBoard further noted that the four general temporary assistance replacement positions \nhad been established for more than 2 years and that the longest position had been \nestablished for 10 years, and therefore they were not temporary in nature.  \n369. The Administration explained that general temporary assistance replacement \npositions were not required to be proposed in the budget according to the policy, and \nfour positions had been reported in the proposed programme budget for 2023.  \n370. The Board is conce rned that the four positions have been inaccurately classified, \nresulting in their not being properly reported in the budget. This may weaken budget \nscrutiny and review.  \n371. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that the concerned \nentity, wi th the guidance of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and \nCompliance, review the classification of those general temporary assistance \nreplacement positions.  \n372.

In its previous report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap. II, paras. 288 \u2013310), the Board no ted \nthe deficiencies in use of personnel contracted by UNOPS, such as lengthy durations \nof service, legal risks in the financial agreements, that established recruitment \nprocesses may not be followed in full and ambiguity concerning the identity of \npersonn el. The Board followed up on this issue and reviewed the recruitment process \nof personnel contracted by UNOPS in the Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the \nDevelopment Coordination  Office and noted the following.  \n \n (i) Lack of established provisions in financial agreements on which selection modality is \nto be used  \n \n374. According to the financial agreements signed between the Secretariat entity and \nUNOPS, there were two modalities t o select personnel contracted by UNOPS. One \nwas a pure preselection process, under which the Secretariat entity was responsible \nfor the entire process, including advertising the position, creating a shortlist of and \ninterviewing candidates, making the sele ction decision, approving appointments and \nsubmitting preselection requests to UNOPS. In the other modality, selection was \nconducted following the regulations and rules of UNOPS, under which the Secretariat \nentity was responsible for interviewing candidate s, making selection decisions, \napproving appointments and submitting recruitment requests to UNOPS, and UNOPS \nwas responsible for advertising the position and providing longlists and shortlists of \ncandidates to the Secretariat.  \n375. The Board noted that t he financial agreements signed between the Secretariat \nentity and UNOPS regulated the selection procedures under these two modalities, but \nlacked provisions that would have provided clarity regarding the circumstances that \nwould determine which modality wo uld apply. Instead, the modality applied was \ndetermined by the Secretariat entity. For example, in 2022, 48 of the 98 personnel in \nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs had been selected following \nthe preselection modality and the other 5 0 personnel were selected following the \nUNOPS rules and regulations.  \n376. The Board is concerned that, as the two modalities are very different, the absence \nof an established provision on which selection modality is to be used may have a \nnegative impact on  the consistency and clarity of the process for the selection of \ncandidates, and pose a risk of insufficient transparency and competitiveness therein.  \n377. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that the entities \nconcerned, in collaboration with UNOPS, clearly stipulate the conditions under \nwhich the respective selection modality is used in the next revised financial \nagreement.  \n378. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (ii) Inconsistency of selection procedure when using the pure preselection modality  \n \n379. On a sample basis, the Board reviewed 34 pure preselection cases in the \nDevelopment Coordination Office, 9 pure preselection cases in the Office for the \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and 8 pure preselection  cases in the Department \nof Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and noted that the selection procedures were \nquite different and were not consistent with the statement in the financial agreements. \nWith regard to the 34 cases in the Development Coordination  Office, the candidates \nwere selected from the informal roster of UNOPS instead of being advertised by the \nDevelopment Coordination Office.

Of the eight cases in the \nDepartment of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, in six cases there was no \nadvertisement and no interview process.  \n380. The Administration explained that in some emergency and urgent situations, the \npure preselection process was simplified and did not include advertisements or \ninterview processes. The entities relied on UNOPS to select the prequalified \ncandidates, which was more efficient and effective.  \n381. The Bo ard is of the view that, though the selection process was clearly stated in \nthe financial agreement, it had not been strictly followed and the actual practice of \npure preselection for the entities varied.  \n382. The Board is concerned that the inconsistency  found regarding the pure \npreselection modality may pose a risk of lack of transparency, competitiveness and \nfairness in the selection of candidates.  \n383. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure the entities \nconcerned clarify the selection proc edures used in the pure preselection modality \nand when and how exceptions could be approved, and that the selection \nprocedures are fully observed.   \n384. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (f) Deficiencies in management of temporary appointments/assignments  \n \n385. In the administrative instruction on the administration of temporary \nappointments ( ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1 ) it is stated that the purpose of a temporary \nappointment is to meet the short -term staffing needs of the Organization. As at \n31 December 2022, among a total of 21,230 staff members of the entities of the \nUnited Nations as reported in volume I, 2,3 66 (11 per cent) held temporary \nappointments, distributed among 55 entities. The Board reviewed the recruitment \nprocess and contract management of and exceptions granted for temporary \nappointments and noted the following deficiencies, set out below.  \n \n (i) During recruitment processes prior to 2022, internal candidates were highlighted \nafter a preliminary assessment  \n \n386. In its resolutions, the General Assembly has requested that the Secretary -\nGeneral treat internal and external candidates equally when cons idering applicants \nfor vacancies.  \n387. On a sample basis, the Board reviewed 9 cases of recruitment relating to \ntemporary assignments to duties at the D -1 level and 14 cases relating to temporary \nassignments from national to international positions at the P-3 level in the Office for \nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; the incumbents were still in those positions \nas at 31 December 2022. The Board noted that all the selected candidates in the 23 \ncases were internal candidates from the Office..  \n388. The Board was informed that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs had conducted a preliminary screening of the applicants by reviewing all \nexternal and internal personal history profiles based on the requirements listed in the \ntemporary job o pening.  \n389. The Board noted that, of the 23 cases, there was a special notice in an email \nregarding the selection process in 16 cases that stated that there were a certain number \nof suitable internal candidates from the Office for the Coordination of Hum anitarian \nAffairs who may be given due consideration during the selection process.

In the cases of temporary job opening \u201cA\u201d and temporary job opening \u201cB\u201d, only \npersonal history profiles of internal candidates were provided when making a \nselection decision. In the case of temporary job opening \u201cC\u201d, the s election panel \nreviewed only internal candidates, although the personal history profiles of all \nsuitable candidates were provided.  \n391. The Administration explained that it used an old email template for special \nnotices prior to 2022 and had discontinued t he use of special notices.  \n392. The Board is of the view that the special notice used in emails prior to 2022 \ncould indicate that internal candidates may have been given priority and external \ncandidates may have been deprived of opportunities to be select ed, which could have \nbeen interpreted as unequal treatment of external candidates during the selection \nprocess, which is inconsistent with General Assembly resolutions on the equal \ntreatment of internal and external candidates, and may affect the reputatio n of the \nOrganization.  \n393. The Board recommends that the Administration continue to use email \ntemplates in which internal candidates are not highlighted during the \nrecruitment process in order to ensure fairness and competitiveness.  \n394.

It is also stated in ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1  that, while the purpose of a temporary \nappointment is to enable the Organization to effectively and expeditiously manage its \nshort -term staffing needs, a temporary appointment should not be used to fill needs \nthat are expected to last for one year or more.  \n396. The Board reviewed the duration of t he use of temporary appointments and \nnoted the following:  \n (a) The same staff held temporary appointments for a long time. The Board \nnoted that 19 staff members had been granted exceptions to breaks in service by the \nsame entity repeatedly, resulting in th e 19 staff members working at the same entity \nfor more four years, with the longest contract lasting seven years and including up to \nfive exceptions;  \n (b) Staff who had temporary appointments held the same position for a lengthy \nduration. The Board noted that 151 positions (without a lien) were encumbered by \nstaff members who had held temporary appointments for at least two consecutive \nyears (including the time the position was vacant) as at 31 December 2022. Of the \n151 positions, 41 were encumbered by staff members who had held temporary \nappointments for at least five consecutive years.  \n397. The Administration explained that the recruitment modality (i.e. the issuance of \na regular or temporary job opening) to be used was determined at the entity leve l and \nwas also subject to the stability of the funding for the position. For those positions \nthat lacked stable funding or were awaiting approval for reclassification by the \ngoverning bodies, a regular job opening was not usually issued.  \n398. The Board is of the view that although the recruitment modality is subject to \nfunding stability, the long -term continuous use of temporary appointments is neither \nin line with the short -term nature of temporary appointments nor is it conducive to \nstability, business co ntinuity and institutional memory.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9701a74-c04b-4673-819a-f360ab62d158": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9701a74-c04b-4673-819a-f360ab62d158", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9e2af37-cd44-4e60-a422-57f12c7d8620", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "323a41e445541a3dbdbd208eceddffa2b0d6c49e878594e791982f6a1d6f1d73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dab4ff10-45cd-448c-9661-81dac2baf5de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "c79fcbb9827b6fbe61a538db7893580ff86a6c7bc844042759838e77f1339770", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8992081b-3a6a-49df-a116-e268e12bf2b5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "53e4f97c53b9fe70f851e23a6112ed072501dd3a8d3b4fab50ce930a13f4d90f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "81dec8d430df3c0885837ee68ca4f3e7c490716815fcddea036d314aab08f723", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  83/396 \n  (iii) Seventeen exceptions relating to temporary appointments/assignments were outside \nthe delegated authority of the approving entities  \n \n399. Based on data provided by the Administration, 2,073 exceptions granted in 20 22 \nwere related to human resources management. The Board reviewed the list of \nexceptions and noted that 76 exceptions were outside the delegated authority of the \nentities that approved them. Among the 76 exceptions, 17 exceptions made by nine \nentities were  related to temporary appointments/assignments, including four cases of \ngranting special post allowances without issuing temporary job openings, nine cases \nof granting temporary appointments/assignments beyond three months without \nissuing temporary job ope nings and four cases of granting temporary \nappointments/assignments beyond 729 days.  \n400. The Board is concerned that the exceptions relating to temporary \nappointments/assignments granted outside the delegated authority, while approved by \nentities, were n ot in compliance with the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United \nNations and posed risks to the management of temporary appointments/assignments.  \n401. The Board reiterates that the Administration should take appropriate action \nto hold the entities accou ntable in the exercise of their delegated authority to grant \nexceptions to human resources administration instructions and avoid having \nentities implement exceptions outside their delegated authority in the future.  \n402. The Administration accepted the reco mmendation.  \n \n (g) Deficiencies in geographical distribution  \n \n403. The General Assembly, in its resolution 77/278  on human resources \nmanagement, requested the Secretary -General to update the system of desirable ranges \nin the Secretariat, with effect from 1 January 2024, to expand the number of posts \nsubject to the system to all posts funded by the regular budget at the Professional and \nhigher categories, including in special  political missions and peacekeeping operations, \nexcluding language posts. The Assembly encouraged the Secretary -General to work \ntowards bringing each unrepresented and underrepresented Member State within its \ndesirable range by 2030, and requested the Sec retary -General to intensify his \ncooperation with all Member States, in particular the unrepresented and \nunderrepresented States, including through targeted outreach, with a view to attracting \nqualified candidates into the selection processes of job opening s in the Secretariat.  \n404. In its previous report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap. II, paras. 335 \u2013339), the Board \nexpressed concern over the failure to achieve the key performance indicator on \ngeographical distribution and the insufficient geographical representation in entities \nof the United Nations as reported in volume I. The Board continued to follow up on \nthe issue of geographical distribution and noted the followin g: \n (a) The number of underrepresented and unrepresented countries had not \ndecreased in the past three years. The number of underrepresented countries in 2020, \n2021 and 2022 were 37, 36 and 37, respectively, and the number of unrepresented \ncountries were 2 0, 21 and 20, respectively, indicating no decrease in the number;  \n (b) The number of geographical posts filled by nationals of some countries \nwas significantly below the lower limit set for those countries. The Board reviewed \nthe gap between the number of current staff and the lower limit set for Member States, \nand noted that the gap with regard to the top three countries was 174, 80 and 25, \nrespectively, as at 31 December 2022;  \n (c) Some geographical posts had been vacant for a long duration. As at 15 Apri l \n2023, of a total of 3,813 geographical posts, 230 posts were vacant. Of those 230 vacant \nposts, 76 had been vacant for more than one year \u2013 the longest for 46 months;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8992081b-3a6a-49df-a116-e268e12bf2b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8992081b-3a6a-49df-a116-e268e12bf2b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3d0bae3-18d9-492d-bd39-7a40b19fb4ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "10ff5dbd0b6f22834bfab9a4e7d37edc4a4fafc070abe6900bab6b47cef79ae3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9701a74-c04b-4673-819a-f360ab62d158", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "81dec8d430df3c0885837ee68ca4f3e7c490716815fcddea036d314aab08f723", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff9d3c5a-b0a3-4bb2-bd90-76ee31d63744", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "a35b0f8e7eb79a6b84e5b14354258c03a1a96e1e56c31d19021f9918782aab6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "53e4f97c53b9fe70f851e23a6112ed072501dd3a8d3b4fab50ce930a13f4d90f", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n84/396 23-11009  \n  (d) Geographical diversity in special political missions and peacekeeping \nmissions nee ded further improvement. As at 31 January 2023, there were 1,134 and 2 \npositions in special political missions and peacekeeping operations, respectively, in \nthe Professional and higher categories (excluding language posts) with a total of 904 \nincumbents. T he Board noted that the 904 posts were distributed among nationals of \n127 countries, indicating that 66 Member States were unrepresented, compared with \n20 unrepresented countries in the Secretariat (excluding the special political missions \nand peacekeeping  operations). And 19 countries were unrepresented in both the \nSecretariat and in special political missions and peacekeeping operations, indicating \nthat the representation status needed improvement;  \n (e) The key performance indicator on geographical distri bution had not been \nachieved for three consecutive years. Among a total of 440 geographical appointments \nin 2022, 96 (22 per cent) of staff members were from unrepresented/underrepresented \ncountries which, for the third consecutive year, did not meet the g oal of 50 per cent. \nThe percentages in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were 20 per cent, 20 per cent and 22 per cent \nrespectively, indicating that little progress had been made;  \n (f) Eighteen heads of entity did not achieve the key performance indicator for \ngeographic al appointments included in their senior managers\u2019 compacts in 2022. Of 38 \nentities that had geographical appointments in 2022, 30 heads of entity had signed a \ncompact with the Secretary -General in 2022. The Board noted that only 3 heads of entity \nachieved  the 50 per cent target, while 9 improved by 10 per cent or more compared with \n2021 (with a rating of \u201cpartially achieved\u201d) and 18 received a rating of \u201cnot achieved\u201d.  \n405. The Board recommends that the Administration issue guidance to special \npolitical mi ssions and peacekeeping missions that are funded by the regular \nbudget to increase their focus on improving equitable geographical distribution.  \n406. The Board also recommends that the Administration pilot, in some \nunderrepresented and unrepresented countries, initiatives to ensure job \nopportunities are sufficiently publicized to attract more applicants and that more \nknowledge is shared on channels, pipelines, qualifications, etc., for them to be \nable to be selected.   \n407. The Administra tion accepted the recommendations.  \n \n 11. Supply chain management  \n \n408. United Nations financial regulation 5.12 provides that procurement functions \ninclude all actions necessary for the acquisition, by purchase or lease, of property, \nincluding products and  real property, and of services, including works. The following \ngeneral principles are to be given due consideration when exercising the procurement \nfunctions of the United Nations: (a) best value for money; (b) fairness, integrity and \ntransparency; (c) ef fective international competition; and (d) the interests of the \nUnited Nations.  \n409. The Procurement Division of the United Nations Secretariat is one of the entities \nof the Office of Supply Chain Management within the Department of Operational \nSupport. I t is responsible for the overall strategic management of United Nations \nprocurement activities and in particular for managing procurement in a transparent, \naccountable and efficient manner for United Nations Headquarters, peacekeeping \nmissions and United N ations agencies.  \n410.

A sample of 18 contracts worth a total of $129 million was selected. The analysis \nrevealed that competition was not always effective and that its quality was affected \nby several weaknesses. Of the 18 contracts sampled, 15  were put out to tender. Their \nanalysis confirmed the transparency of the procedure implemented, in particular for \nthe contracts submitted to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts, which provides \nadvice to the relevant authorized official regarding the p rocedures and decisions \nabove certain thresholds.  \n \n  Lack of in -depth knowledge of potential applicants during the pre -contract phase  \n \n412. According to the United Nations Global Marketplace, the Secretariat finalized \n7,088 contracts in 2021 and 2022. A total of 57,255 vendors were invited to tender. \nHowever, 1,523 contracts (21 per cent) were awarded to a service provider that was \nnot solicited.  \n413. The ability of the Organization to reach a large number of companies appears to \nhave weakened. Only 17,6 40 companies of the 57,255 invited responded. The situation \nvaried according to the product categories. For all cases sampled, no more than one or \ntwo suppliers effectively competed for a tender. Such a situation is not likely to ensure \nefficient competiti on nor is it an optimal use of the Organization\u2019s resources.  \n414. This assessment was confirmed by the analysis of the sample audited. The \nnumber of potential applicants that responded to the requests for expressions of \ninterest issued by the Procurement Division, were published on the United Nations \nGlobal Marketplace and on the website of the Procurement Division and subsequently \nsubmitted a formal proposal appeared to be low, as shown in table II.29.  \n \n  Table II.29  \n  Supplier expressions of interest during United Nations solicitations  \n \n \n Requests for \nexpressions of \ninterest issued  Expression \nof interest \nreceived  Added \napplicants  Invitations \nsent Replies \nreceived  \n      Drugs and pharmaceutical products (5 lots)  3 069  232 No 93 11 \nSecurity uniforms  Unknown  151 72 223 5 \nTravel management services  Unknown  25 No 21 3 \nInformation technology application and software \ndevelopment (2 lots)  Unknown  78 83 161 7 (lot 1), \n8 (lot 2)  \nICT services for physical security at Headquarters  Unknown  27 No 27 1 \nPortfolio risk and performance analysis  Unknown  50 No 50 12 \nOffice systems furniture  Unknown  23 17 40 4 \nCatering services  Unknown  11 16 27 2 \nHeadquarters gardening services  Unknown  3 17 20 3 \nHeadquarters dry cleaning services  8 1 5 6 1 \n \nSource : Files provided by the Administration.  \n \n \n415.

According to the Board\u2019s \nestimates, this provider was able to pass on, unchallenged, a 11.5 per cent increase i n \nthe cost of its services.  \n416. Three main reasons for the difficulties in attracting applicants to United Nations \ncontracts were identified. First, the United Nations Global Marketplace Internet \nportal, while it includes tender notices, is not precise en ough to identify potential \nsuppliers. While many may receive an invitation, some are clearly not in a position \nto respond to the tender at a later stage. Second, market research is mainly limited to \nidentifying potential suppliers that produce goods or ser vices related to the activity \nwithout investigating whether their offer can meet the more specific needs of the \nUnited Nations. For example, regarding ICT services for physical security at United \nNations Headquarters, only the incumbent company responded t o the new tender \nbecause the implementation of the contract was subject to a certification by the \nindustrial producer of the gates used at Headquarters, a condition that had not been \ninitially identified by the Office of Information and Communications Tech nology and \nthe Procurement Division. The procedure had to be restarted from scratch to ensure \nthat only certified companies were invited, resulting in a four -month delay. Finally, \ndemanding technical specifications can discourage suppliers: in one case, th e \ntechnical specifications gave rise to 119 requests for clarification from the 40 \ncompanies invited.  \n \n  Very low number of remaining applicants after the technical analysis  \n \n417. The technical analysis of the offers can result in a significant reduction i n \ncompetition. When the solicitation is launched, the technical analysis may lead to the \nelimination of most of the offers received (described as non -admissible) before any \nscoring occurs, particularly with regard to commercial offers. As a result, the num ber \nof suppliers put out to tender at the end of the technical procedure rarely exceeds three \noffers, including that of the incumbent supplier.  \n418. This lack of competition benefits the incumbent company at the expense of the \ncost-effectiveness of procur ement. For the contract concerning office systems \nfurniture, the only offer retained after the technical analysis was the incumbent \ncompany, which was the most expensive of the four applicants. For the risk and \nperformance analysis contract for the United Nations investment portfolio, two bids, \nconsidered technically valid, were rejected for having substantially revised their \nprices upward and the incumbent company won without any economic competition.  \n419. In other cases, when the number of technically val idated responses is too low, \nthe Administration may decide that all of them should be retained. Competition does \nnot allow for the selection of suppliers but leads to a shared market among applicants. \nThis was the case for three translation services contra cts and for lot 1 of the drugs \nand pharmaceutical products procurement contract.  \n420. Too few applicants participating in a commercial assessment leads to negative \nconsequences. It does not ensure that the Administration chooses the most \ncompetitive suppli ers. It also results in the frequent renewal of contracts with existing \nsuppliers after tendering (in 90 per cent of the contracts examined in the sample), \nwhich is certainly considered discouraging by bidders other than the incumbents.  \n \n  Very long contra cting period  \n \n421. For all 18 selected cases, the time required to award contracts was much longer \nthan the six months expected. The expected duration of a competitive bidding \nprocedure, according to the documents initially signed (i.e. standard sourcing p lans, \nwhich define the framework and schedule of the solicitations), is around six months, \nwhich is the usual duration for this type of contract.

The time required to award contracts was very long \u2013 two years \nfor the information technology application and software development contracts, 20 \nmonths for the drugs and pharmaceutical products contracts, 18 months for French \ntranslation services and 17 months for the provision of security uniforms.  \n422. The fa ct that the United Nations is an organization with complex needs can in \nmany cases affect the procurement process but cannot justify the delays observed.  \n423. These examples demonstrate a need to plan with the requisitioner in advance to \ndetermine when he r or his experts are available for key tasks such as the technical \nanalysis and the review of the documents received from the applicants. When the \nrequisitioner believes her or his staff are not available and that the expected timeline \nwould be difficult t o meet, the solicitation process should be revised accordingly. All \nthese issues should be addressed in due course during procurement planning.  \n424. The long time frames for awarding contracts can also have other drawbacks. \nThey sometimes result in amendm ents that revise the initial prices. For example, with \nregard to the catering services contract, the clauses on the rules for amortizing \ninvestments and on the conditions for revising prices were added by amendment, \ntogether with compulsory appendices, 14 months after the launch of the service. The \nlong time frames also tend to discourage suppliers that are not selected when they \nreceive letters of regret after long periods without any news; for example, during the \ndebriefing meeting on the information tech nology application and software \ndevelopment contracts, some bidders expressed their dissatisfaction at the long wait \nand their desire to take legal action. Furthermore, the long time frames usually require \nthe Administration to extend the existing contract s beyond their expiration dates \n(11 months for the information technology application and software development \ncontracts, 6 to 9 months for the drugs and pharmaceutical products contracts, \n6 months for the catering services contract, etc.).  \n \n (ii) Substan tial modifications of contracts by amendments  \n \n425. Once the contracts have been signed, some are subject to a high number of \namendments, with consequences.  \n426. The Board noted that in the case of the catering services contract, there had been \n14 amendments in eight years. The amendments have led to price increases beyond \nwhat was initially foreseen, a reduction in the investments initially agreed and \nchanges in the rules for the payment of fees by the contractor to the advantage of the \ncontractor.  The conditions of the contract were substantially modified, first \ntemporarily and then definitively, and moved the risk from the contractor, with a \npayment of fixed fees to the contractor from the Organization, to a \u201ccost -plus\u201d \ncontract in which the contr actor provided monthly statements of its costs and revenues \nand claims for those amounts to the United Nations plus a fixed margin \u2013 with the \nfinancial risks being taken entirely by the United Nations. As a result of these \nsuccessive changes, though the Un ited Nations had expected to earn $3.5 million over \nthe 2015 \u20132019 period according to the terms of the contract initially signed, the \nOrganization incurred losses of $1.9 million. This loss worsened by $4.9 million from \nNovember 2019 to October 2022 owing to the COVID -19 pandemic and to the \ntransfer of all the risks to the United Nations. The Administration considered that \nnegotiating a solution with the service provider, which resulted in significant losses, \nwas in the best interests of the Organization.

The Board is con cerned that such contract extensions, with substantial changes \nto the initially negotiated contract terms, have the effect of moving the prices paid by \nthe United Nations away from the best market conditions for their supplies.  \n \n (iii) Recurring exceptions  to the general procurement rule of open competition  \n \n428. A high proportion of the contracts signed with vendors by the United Nations \ndo not fall under the standard competitive bidding procedure but are authorized \nthrough waivers without competition unde r rule 105.16 of the Financial Regulations \nand Rules of the United Nations. The Secretariat calculated that this was the case for \n24 per cent of contracts, representing 20 per cent of the total procurement value in \n2022. However, this figure includes cases  of \u201cpiggybacking\u201d (using calls for tender \nfrom other United Nations agencies), and therefore does not provide an adequate \nestimate of exceptions to the normal bidding procedure.  \n429. The Board noted that in the sample of 18 contracts audited, 3 contracts  were \ninitially awarded without competition or after restricted competition. One case \nconcerns the maintenance of standardized software with a particular firm. In the two \nother cases, the Secretariat resorted to a \u201cpiggybacking\u201d procedure.  \n430. The Board a lso observed that waivers without competition were frequently used \nwhen only one (in 2 cases of the 18 sampled) or too few companies (4 cases of 18) \nremained in the competition process after the technical analysis. The Secretariat \nfollowed acceptable proce dures after a waiver was approved by the Headquarters \nCommittee on Contracts. However, such frequent recourse to waivers may have the \neffect of further restraining competition at the Organization\u2019s expense. The \nHeadquarters Committee on Contracts noted tha t there did not seem to be a standard \npractice in the Procurement Division regarding the issuance of exemptions to \ncompetitive bidding. While some procurement officers seek and obtain an exemption \nprior to conducting a solicitation, others first conduct a solicitation exercise and then \nrequest an exemption through the process of vetting and approving the \nrecommendation for an award. As a consequence, the Headquarters Committee on \nContracts recommended that clarification and guidance be provided regarding th e \nappropriate procedure for seeking exemptions to competitive bidding.  \n431. The Board recommends that the Administration, at the level of the \nHeadquarters Committee on Contracts, issue an annual report based on its \nreviews, focusing on key areas of improv ement and good practices that should \nbe shared widely.   \n432. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (b) Need to optimize the vendor database  \n \n433. A database of vendors has been built at the Secretariat level. To maximize the \nusefulness of this database, the Procurement Manual states that vendors wishing to \nparticipate in solicitations conducted by the Secretariat must have completed the \nprocess of self -registration in the United Nations Global Marketplace portal, and that \nthis information has to  be regularly maintained in the respective vendor files.  \n434. The way the vendor database is designed and updated can be improved. A total \nof 343,589 vendors have been registered in the United Nations Global Marketplace \nas of February 2023. This very larg e figure is far from the number of companies that \nactually do business with the United Nations (as seen above, only 17,640 suppliers \nresponded to an invitation to bid from the Organization in 2021 and 2022) and \nsuggests that most of the registered vendors do not respond to tenders.

Therefo re, the current United Nations \nGlobal Marketplace vendor database can be improved by identifying suitable \nsuppliers for specific procurement needs.  \n435. To assess whether the active vendor files in the United Nations Global \nMarketplace can be useful for t he Organization\u2019s needs, a sample of 19 vendors was \nselected. There was no update to the financial information of the vendor in 18 per \ncent of the cases for level -2 suppliers; 45 per cent of suppliers at all levels had been \nupdated before 2021; and only 3 per cent of suppliers at all levels had been updated \nsince 2021.  \n436. If information is incomplete, the usefulness of the database for market research \npurposes is compromised. In one case, concerning support and maintenance services \nfor the physical securi ty of United Nations Headquarters, the lack of up -to-date \nvendor files created difficulties in the procurement procedure. The Headquarters \nCommittee on Contracts concurred with this issue and noted in one of its reports that \nthere was either outdated conta ct information in the United Nations Global \nMarketplace or no information at all.  \n437. Outreach efforts to assess the market could be strengthened, for example in the \nfield of human resources services. The importance of periodically reassessing the \nmarket , particularly for products and services that are rapidly evolving in certain \ngeographical areas and industries, is stressed in section 5.2 of the Procurement \nManual. The main source on which market research is based is the United Nations \nGlobal Marketplac e; however, this database is not sufficiently up -to-date or precise \nenough to efficiently conduct a market assessment. Although an outreach effort was \nmade which led to an increase in the number of responses to its calls for suppliers at \nthe beginning of 2 023, the Administration has not developed a centralized programme \nof outreach actions based on the United Nations Global Marketplace, and possibly \nbeyond, that could be shared with the Board.  \n438. The publishing of announcements of business opportunities is another method \nconsidered by the Procurement Manual in order to reach an adequate number of \nsuppliers. The Organization issues a large number of requests for expressions of \ninterest: 2,075 were issued in 2021 and 2022. Requests for expressions of intere st are \noften sent to the vendors that are registered in the United Nations Global Marketplace; \nthey are also advertised on the entity\u2019s website, the Procurement Division\u2019s website, \nthe United Nations Global Marketplace and, when considered appropriate, in other \nmedia. However, the results are sometimes disappointing, even for simple services \nsuch as laundry and cleaning.  \n439. The Board recommends that the Administration explore ways to \nsystematically review and update the vendor database as well as the fin ancial \ninformation of vendors that are selected for award.   \n440. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (c) Vendor Review Committee: a useful instrument that needs a few improvements  \n \n441. The management of sanctions of vendors who may have engaged in proscribed \npractices is handled by a dedicated structure. The Vendor Review Committee is an \ninternal administrative body tasked with making recommendations regarding possible \nsanctions against, and possible reinstatements of, vendors in cases of  corruption, \nfraud, coercion or obstruction, among other things, or of failure to perform in \naccordance with the terms and conditions of their contracts. The Board noted that the \nexistence of this Committee is particularly relevant for a large organization  like the \nUnited Nations, which operates in many different countries.

The Board noted that the functioning of the Vendor Review Committee could be \nimproved. Although it has been in place for years, the Committee still lacks useful \ninstruments that could enable its work and enhance the quality and the equity of its \nadvice. For instance, there is no guideline for sanctions, and two sets of minutes of \nthe Vendor Review Committee meetings from the past two years were not, and have \nstill not been, signed by the Committee Chair prior to their approval by the Under -\nSecretary -General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.  \n443. The Administration confirmed that the lack of the signing of meeting minutes \nwas not a satisfactory practice and could significantly slow down the process, but \nexplained that this was not the case for the most important pieces of advice, which \nwere given priority, and that pending submission by the Chair of the Vendor Review \nCommittee to the Under -Secretary -General for Management Strategy, Policy and \nCompliance for decision, the Vendor Review Committee\u2019s recommendations on \nsuspension were applied on a temporary provisional basis.  \n444. The reinstatement of companies that have been suspended in the past requires \nthe finding of a reasonable balance between deterrence, risk to the Organizati on and \nthe need to ensure sufficient competition. An illustration can be found in the way the \naftermath of the \u201coil -for-food programme\u201d fraud scheme nearly 20 years ago was \nmanaged. More than a hundred vendors were suspended for six months. Owing to the \ncomplexity of the reinstatement procedure (there were 14 items requiring verification \nin the standard letter of reinstatement), most of them did not engage in a reinstatement \nprocess (only 27 of the 115 suspended suppliers were effectively reinstalled). This  led \nto at least one case in which urgent decisions had to be taken in order to obtain \nCOVID -19-related medicines from one of the suspended companies. Drafting \nsimplified reinstatement conditions for vendors after their suspension time has \nexpired that wer e more fluid and realistic could benefit current practice.  \n445. The detection of alleged wrongdoings by suppliers under contract originates \nfrom United Nations officials in the field, among other sources; however, the process \nsuffers from several shortcomi ngs. The Administration has issued guidance, \npublished a handbook on fraud and corruption awareness and organized training \nsessions in order to raise awareness and address the problem. In situations where a \nmisconduct report includes prima facie evidence o f procurement fraud that indicates \ncollusion between United Nations officials and local vendors, OIOS will conduct an \nenquiry. Nevertheless, several shortcomings were observed, notably the fact that no \ndetection policy seems to exist, although the Board wa s advised that under the \nProcurement Network of the High -level Committee on Management, the \nAdministration was working on a possible tool for detection and that an expression \nof interest had been advertised for this purpose. It could be useful for the Orga nization \nto consider allocating resources for this purpose. In reviewing a sample of \nprocurement files, the Board noted that the assessment of the contract performance \nwas often not detailed enough. In addition, no policy of rotation for procurement staff \nhad been put in place in the United Nations, even though a well -established good \npractice to prevent corruption or collusion was to limit the duration of assignments.  \n446. Finally, even if all United Nations agencies shared a single United Nations \nGlobal Marketplace vendor database, there was limited coordination between them as \nfar as sanctions, procedures and delays were concerned. The Global Marketplace \nserves as the central database listing all sanctions. It is up to each entity, if it wishes, \nto apply  mutual recognition of a sanctioned vendor. That is why in certain cases, for \noperational reasons, exceptions are allowed in the model policy framework for vendor \nsanctions.

This important issue should be addressed, as it casts some \ndoubt on the efficiency of the sanctions procedure in the context of the One United \nNations initiative.  \n447. The Board recommends that the Administration strengthen the \ncoordination on vendor sanctions with other agencies, funds and programmes of \nthe United Nations system, with the objective of assessing the feasibility and \nbenefits of establishing, in the medium -term, a joint vendor committee to \nharmonize procedures and actions taken.  \n448.

In his report entitled \u201cShifting the management paradigm in the United Nations: \nensuring a better future for all\u201d ( A/72/492 ), the Secretary -General stated: \u201cI am \ndelegating managerial authority to programme managers and demanding greater \naccountability from them for mandate delivery.\u201d The General Assembly, in its \nresolution 72/266 A, stressed that accountability was a central principle of \nmanagement reform.  \n450. In its report entitled \u201cFinancial reports and audited financial statements, and \nreports of the Board of Auditors for the period ended  31 December 2021\u201d, the \nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions emphasized that \nincreased delegated authority must be matched by enhanced transparency and \naccountability, and stressed the importance of timely and proactive action, in \nparticular by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, to \nexpand key performance indicators to ensure full coverage of key risks; provide \noperational guidance to support the exercise of delegated authority; monitor more \nclosely the perf ormance of entities, with special attention given to recurring \ndeficiencies raised by the oversight bodies; and ensure accountability and timely \nremedial action to address underperformance ( A/77/574 , para. 62).  \n451. The Board reviewed the delegation of authority, the monitoring thereon, and the \naccountability framework, among other things, and identified the issues set out below.  \n \n (a) Delegation of authority  \n \n (i) Revised delegation of authority policy framework needs to be promulgated in an \nexpeditious manner  \n \n452.

The Board recommends that the Administration expedite the review and \nrelease of the delegation of authority policy framework and put in place a mo re \nagile process to update the delegation of authority policy framework in response \nto changes to the wider policy framework.  \n456. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (ii) Opportunities for further improvement in the existing key performance indicators for \ndelegation of authority  \n \n457. The Board reviewed the existing 16 key performance indicators and noted the \nfollowing:  \n (a) Some of the indicators were not sufficiently relevant to delegation of \nauthority. The Board noted that some key perfor mance indicators were not sufficiently \nrelevant to delegation of authority, including the 120 -day recruitment target, \nmandatory learning for all, timely payments to service providers and the advance \ntravel purchase policy. The Administration explained that  some key performance \nindicators were important to monitor as they covered areas that were emphasized by \nthe governing bodies, and therefore were included in the set of indicators. Meanwhile, \nkey performance indicators were not solely determined by the Bus iness \nTransformation and Accountability Division but also took into account policy, \nprocesses and the suggestions of business owners. The Administration would analyse \nand implement changes to the monitoring framework as part of the shift in the \nsoftware pl atform to the SAP Analytics Cloud in Umoja (Umoja Analytics). The \nAdministration also indicated that some of the indicators measured decisions, and \nwere relevant to delegation of authority key performance indicators;  \n (b) Target monitoring needed to be int ensified to identify opportunities to \nimprove overall performance. Current monitoring and analysis methods were largely \nfocused on results at the global level, which did not systematically facilitate a more \ngranular and targeted analysis to identify underp erforming entities that had a bigger \ninfluence on overall performance with regard to key performance indicators. In this \nregard, target monitoring and analysis of an individual entity\u2019s performance as it \nrelated to specific key performance indicators would  facilitate follow -up, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7be4488-99ea-43b2-8a65-133ba4ff3466": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7be4488-99ea-43b2-8a65-133ba4ff3466", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d43d603d-da83-4f26-ab26-ebdf8cb68d52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "80855257dd8df11fd511c207f70460c248a3e9f506a2d1245bf9133e10ae1730", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2abca3f0-7c26-4288-a4dc-1521a79f02ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "80f4f80dadcf50595de9adcadf92f73138cc32e5ba036c87f0d31095e0213c89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1806d8c5-2234-428e-b228-63408a4d38aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "e636132151053efae63743ab62444df070cfdb1d69cdf6345786cab71eacdfbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ee647b3df95005fb8f8f2feefedac0f6a838e41610e156fd7383b2e9f19fdbe3", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  93/396 \n remedial actions taken in a timely manner would facilitate better understanding of \nbottlenecks, root causes of underperformance, improved decision -making, more \ntargeted resolutions, accountability and enhancement of performance.  \n458. The Board recommends that the Administration conduct a review of the \nexisting key performance indicators to ensure that only those key performance \nindicators measuring the impact of decisions are used for monitoring delegation \nof authority before the shift to Umoja Analytics, and conduct more granular and \ntargeted analysis on the priority results of delegation of authority monitoring.   \n459. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Remedial action needed to improve performance with regard  to certain key \nperformance indicators  \n \n460. In its previous report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap. II, para. 381), the Board noted that \nthe performance of relevant entities against eight key performance indicators did not \nmeet the expected targets, and that individual entities received unsatisfactory results \nin relation to three indicators in 2021, and stressed that the Administration needed to \nmake further efforts to strengthen the accountability framework for delegation of \nauthority by making concrete recommendations to the relevant entities on ways to \nimprove  the Secretariat\u2019s performance against the key performance indicators.  \n461. The Board continued to review the performance against the existing 16 key \nperformance indicators and noted that performance relating to 9 indicators had not \nreached their targets a t the end of 2022; that for 2 indicators, on the timely reporting \nof human resources exceptions and on timely payments for goods and services, \nperformance did not improve compared with 2021; and that the results of some \nindividual entities were far below t he target, which had a negative impact on global \nresults.  \n462. The Board further noted that no sufficient remedial action had been taken in this \nregard to address the shortfalls, although the same deficiencies had been identified in \nits previous audit.  \n463. The Board recommends that the Administration enhance the first line of \nmonitoring by making more frequent use of accountability indicator monitoring \nand measure progress in the next cycle of the statement of internal control.  \n464. The Administration ac cepted the recommendation.  \n \n (b) Strategic planning, budgeting and performance management solution is not \nfunctioning as intended  \n \n465. The strategic planning, budgeting and performance management solution \nsupports the Secretary -General\u2019s management reform  and is intended to serve as the \nsystem of record for all approved programme plans and results -based budgets and to \nprovide a framework for continuous monitoring to ensure effective programme \ndelivery. It includes three parts: the strategic management appl ication module; the \nintegrated planning, monitoring and reporting solution; and the Business Planning \nand Consolidation module. The Board reviewed the functioning of the strategic \nplanning, budgeting and performance management solution and noted the follow ing: \n (a) There was insufficient use of the integrated planning, monitoring and \nreporting solution to monitor projects funded from extrabudgetary resources. The \nBoard was informed that the solution was used to monitor projects funded by \nvoluntary contribut ions while the strategic management application module monitors \nprogrammes funded by the regular budget and assessed contributions of peacekeeping \nmissions.

The Board is of the view that the \nuse of the integrated planning, m onitoring and reporting solution could be leveraged \nfor projects financed by all funding sources, given its flexibility and numerous \nfunctionalities. The coverage and monitoring need to be greatly enhanced in order to \nprovide closer monitoring on projects at each entity to better show the progress \ntowards mandate delivery;  \n (b) The strategic management application module was only being used as a \nprogramme reporting tool, not as a programme planning and budgeting tool, as \nintended.  \n466. The Board recommends that the Administration encourage expanding the \ncoverage of the planning and monitoring function of the integrated planning, \nmonitoring and reporting solution to other funding sources besides \nextrabudgetary sources.  \n467. The Board also recommends that the Administration make progress \ntowards using the strategic management application module for programme \nplanning purposes besides monitoring.  \n468. The Administration accepted the recommendations.  \n \n (c) Deficiencies in the current evaluation policy framework  \n \n469. The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme \nAspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of \nEvaluation ( ST/SGB/2018/3 ) define evaluation as \u201ca process that seeks to determine \nas systematically and objectively as possible the relevance, effectiveness and impact \nof an activity in the light of its goals, objecti ves and accomplishments\u201d.  \n470. The Secretary -General\u2019s vision to strengthen the evaluation capacity of the \nSecretariat (see A/72/492 ) led to the administrative instruction on evaluation in the \nUnited Nations Secretariat ( ST/AI/2021/3 ) issued in August 2021. The administrative \ninstruction lays out the requirements for the Secretariat with regard  to evaluation, \nincluding the establishment of the Evaluation Management Committee as a \nsubcommittee of the Management Committee, which was accomplished in 2022. The \nBoard was informed that OIOS and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy \nand Complia nce provide joint support to Secretariat entities with regard to \nimplementing the administrative instruction.  \n471. The Board reviewed the policy framework for evaluation and its implementation \nat the Secretariat and noted the following:  \n (a) More clarity a nd guidance were needed in relation to, inter alia, the \ndefinition of internal evaluation, its coverage and frequency, the resources available, \nmethodology (i.e. a one -size-fits-all or a more tailored approach based on the \ncharacteristics of the entity) an d the utilization of the results;  \n (b) There was a lack of clear definition regarding the roles and responsibilities \nof the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and OIOS in \nperforming this function.  \n472. The Board is concerned that the policy framework for evaluation needs to be \nreviewed and updated where necessary to better guide the implementation of \nevaluations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92b0fab7-2986-451a-b206-25c961aad297": {"__data__": {"id_": "92b0fab7-2986-451a-b206-25c961aad297", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ca51f93-569a-4cc4-bb38-3a78a3f9b1e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "75f6b8497a5433d5ee4950d8a4d2d1234b12d423d0d4656f7b4fdd664986d567", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1806d8c5-2234-428e-b228-63408a4d38aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "e636132151053efae63743ab62444df070cfdb1d69cdf6345786cab71eacdfbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fffb2076-2603-43c0-9364-0a4753d08b9e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ef4cc16526d6be443c7c06bdd7455a6bd981e795799d45d1c2a068f3e437eb39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e9f050bdbe9964a5c9864b25e09bdd058917b7a7333589635ab2393d0c04e971", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  95/396 \n 473. The Board recommends that the Administration undertake the planned \nreview of ST/AI/2021/3  to enhance the clarity of the definitions of the scope, \nresources and evaluators and the use of evaluation results.  \n474. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (d) Senior managers\u2019 comp acts in need of further enhancement  \n \n475. In its previous report ( A/77/5 (Vol. I) , chap. II, para. 409), the Board raised \nconcerns that material and recurring compliance issues needed to be considered in \norder to assess senior managers\u2019 performance. The Board continued its review in this \nregard, noting that a total of 76 senior managers\u2019 compacts for 2022 had been signed, \nand also noted the following:  \n (a) The Assistant S ecretary -General compact module was not rolled out in \nInspira in a timely manner as originally planned. The Board noted that the Assistant \nSecretary -General compact signed with the Under -Secretary -General had not yet been \nembedded into the Inspira system a s planned in 2022, but had been delayed to the \nsecond quarter of 2023;  \n (b) The Board reviewed the latest template for the compact and is of the view \nthat revision needs to be made to some key performance indicators. For instance, the \nindicator relating to  equitable geographical distribution could be revised to focus on \nthe overall progress of an entity towards achieving that purpose, rather than focusing \non newly appointed posts. With regard to the indicator relating to financial resources, \nit could focus on the proper use, custodianship and stewardship of the financial \nresources entrusted to the head of entity, rather than on the timely submission of \ndocuments. In addition, for indicators applicable to field missions, the Board is of the \nview that for thos e indicators relating to organizational resilience, coherence in \nUnited Nations leadership and human rights, the current compact does not specify \nclearly the baseline and targets of those indicators, as well as the way they are \nmeasured and how the data sh ould be collected.  \n476. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure indicators in the \nsenior managers\u2019 compact are reviewed during the meeting of the Management \nPerformance Board at the end of 2023, taking into consideration the findings \nmentioned above.  \n477. The Administration accepted the recommendation, while noting that the \ncompact was used by the Secretary -General as a performance management tool for \nhis senior managers and that other mechanisms existed to measure entity \nperformance. The Admini stration further noted that while the compact template was \nreviewed annually by the Management Performance Board, the final decision on any \nchanges or additions rested with the Secretary -General.  \n \n 13. Development reform  \n \n478. The development system of the  United Nations has, since 2016, been centred on \nthe goal of realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and a series of \nreforms have been put in place in this regard. The core of the development reform is \na reinvigorated resident coordinator sy stem and a new, strengthened generation of \nUnited Nations country teams. Some key efficiency initiatives were put forward, with \na total expected savings of $310 million. The Board has been following up on the \nimplementation of the reform initiatives and ha s identified in previous audits some \ndeficiencies in relation to, among others, the funding of the special purpose trust fund, \nvacancies in the resident coordinator system, overreliance on resident coordinators ad \ninterim and backlogs in the implementation  of key efficiency initiatives, including", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fffb2076-2603-43c0-9364-0a4753d08b9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fffb2076-2603-43c0-9364-0a4753d08b9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eaa4f75a-b2cc-4c12-9aa6-4122fc0f9106", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "d83ede607e94e26085422f91c1b8a35e8306a9264f59b349cb5a2d625e8525f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92b0fab7-2986-451a-b206-25c961aad297", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "e9f050bdbe9964a5c9864b25e09bdd058917b7a7333589635ab2393d0c04e971", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8fc6aa3-ba51-4f4a-9f7f-9d7e4407fd25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "39a8a8cd378dc57fcb4e91da4689f2c17cae8fde9f88c0c2ffd81c37f6700c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ef4cc16526d6be443c7c06bdd7455a6bd981e795799d45d1c2a068f3e437eb39", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n96/396 23-11009  \n United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks, common back \noffices and common premises.  \n479.

The Board followed up on those concerns and noted the efforts made, including \nmeasures taken to fill resident coordinator positions and the implementation of the \nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks. Notwithstanding \nthose efforts and the progress made, the Board also identified areas for further \nimprovement, set out below.  \n \n (a) Adverse impacts resulted from liquidity challenges relating to the special \npurpose trust fund  \n \n481. On 11 July 2018, the Secretary -General established the special purpose trust \nfund, in line with General Assembly resolution 72/279 , to receive, consolidate, \nmanage and acc ount for contributions and financial transactions of the resident \ncoordinator system.  \n482. The Board noted that the recognized revenue intended for 2022 was $189.12 \nmillion and the cash collected during the year was $169.68 million, which were, \nrespectivel y, $92.71 million and $112.15 million less than the approved budget of \n$281.83 million. The shortfall of cash collection in 2022 was due mainly to a \nreduction in collection of voluntary contributions, which was $88.71 million less than \nthe budgeted amount.  In addition, of the $42.67 million in revenue recognized for the \n1 per cent coordination levy in 2022, $29.31 million was collected in cash by year -\nend. Meanwhile, expenditures increased by $18.96 million to $225.63 million in 2022 \nas a result of increase s in post and other staff costs as well as in travelling expenses. \nAs a result, the special purpose trust fund had a deficit of $36.51 million in 2022.  \n483. The Board also noted that the deficit in 2022 depleted the special purpose trust \nfund\u2019s cumulative cash balance to $40.86 million, $1.14 million below the $42.00 \nmillion cash reserve required for operations, which was set at approximately 15 per \ncent of the annual budget of $281.83 million for the Development Coordination \nOffice. This depletion in cash balance poses a significant threat to the liquidity of the \nspecial purpose trust fund in terms of supporting the sustainable operation and \ndevelopment of the resident coordinator system.  \n484. The Board was informed that the Administration had adopted sever al measures \nto control expenses, which included:  \n (a) Reducing the country -level coordination funding, which drastically \ndiminished the opportunities for resident coordinators to bring together United \nNations country teams on common initiatives and priorit ies ($22.23 million and \n$11.95 million were allocated to the coordination fund (under the special purpose \ntrust fund) for 2022 and 2023, respectively, out of a $35.00 million budget envelope);  \n (b) Slowing the implementation of various initiatives under ef ficiency reform, \nsuch as the business operations strategy, and the establishment of common back \noffices and common premises;  \n (c) Pausing hiring for 45 vacancies in 2023, which would undermine the total \nhuman resources personnel needed to meet the increas ing demands from stakeholders;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8fc6aa3-ba51-4f4a-9f7f-9d7e4407fd25": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8fc6aa3-ba51-4f4a-9f7f-9d7e4407fd25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2bb307d-fd26-4dda-8144-ac36bac85d3c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "50525cc344b2eae68b8e6ec7463fcebab78d598a94d9529f4e29abcd169c3185", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fffb2076-2603-43c0-9364-0a4753d08b9e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ef4cc16526d6be443c7c06bdd7455a6bd981e795799d45d1c2a068f3e437eb39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9520c9e7-c9a4-42a3-9471-f15b49134075", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "3ef80f3b8a443e416df08d8a60663d2b36d84c491fbed93da2dfb5995d26cb1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "39a8a8cd378dc57fcb4e91da4689f2c17cae8fde9f88c0c2ffd81c37f6700c57", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  97/396 \n  (d) Reducing the Development Coordination Office\u2019s engagement in \nsupporting regional coordination and cross -border integrated analyses and joint \nprogramming;  \n (e) Scaling down support at the country level, such as assistance  with common \ncountry analyses and the development of United Nations Sustainable Development \nCooperation Frameworks, and engagement with international financial institutions \ntowards financing countries\u2019 development initiatives;  \n (f) Delaying or suspending s ome of the planned improvements to the UN -Info \ndata platform.  \n485. The Board is concerned that if the liquidity challenge remains unaddressed, this \nsituation could lead to unmet expectations of Member States, diminish the relevance \nof the United Nations de velopment system and hamper the ability of the resident \ncoordinator system to implement its mandate and meet the growing calls by \nstakeholders for increased coordination efforts.  \n486. The Board recommends that the Administration take measures to ensure \nadequate liquidity to finance operational requirements in the short -term, \nincluding ensuring measures for the timely recovery of outstanding receivables, \nand formulate a comprehensive scenario analysis which covers short -, medium - \nand long -term plans to addre ss the potential liquidity challenge.  \n487. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (b) Deficiencies in management of resident coordinator positions  \n \n488. In its previous audit, the Board noted deficiencies in appointing non -temporary \nresident co ordinators to fill positions. The Board continued its review in this regard \nin 2022 and noted that 17 of 130 resident coordinator positions (13 per cent) were \nvacant as at 31 December 2022. Sixteen of the vacant positions had been temporarily \nfilled by a r esident coordinator ad interim, while the remaining position remained \nunfilled. The Board further reviewed the status of resident coordinator positions from \n2019 to 2022 and noted that there were gaps in reaching full strength for four \nconsecutive years. I n addition, among the 17 vacant resident coordinator positions, \n7 positions had been vacant for more than one year, and 3 of those 7 positions \nremained vacant owing to the lack of suitable candidates even though the positions \nhad been advertised several ti mes.  \n489. The Board noted that there were 83 appointments of resident coordinators ad \ninterim during the period from 2019 to 2022 (1 appointment in 2019, 3 in 2020, 14 in \n2021 and 65 in 2022) and that some personnel had been appointed more than once \nafter  their initial appointments ended. In addition, there were seven resident \ncoordinators ad interim (6 per cent) who had been in the position for more than one \nyear, and the longest tenure of a resident coordinator ad interim was close to four \nyears. Further more, with regard to 12 resident coordinator positions, there had been \nfrequent changes in personnel serving as resident coordinators ad interim, each of \nwhom served for fewer than 90 days. Two of the positions that had been filled by \nresident coordinators  ad interim had been changed seven times, and the shortest \nresident coordinator ad interim tenure lasted only three days.  \n490. The Board is concerned that long -term vacancies of resident coordinator \npositions in specific countries will lead to backlogs in delivering mandates at the \ncountry level. The use of resident coordinators ad interim to fill resident coordinator \nvacancies over a long period is not beneficial to position management, given that the \nappointment of resident coordinators ad interim should be for temporary assignments. \nFurthermore, the frequent change of resident coordinators ad interim will have an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9520c9e7-c9a4-42a3-9471-f15b49134075": {"__data__": {"id_": "9520c9e7-c9a4-42a3-9471-f15b49134075", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfff364a-9c9c-4259-a6b4-6f7d6243c74f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "40cf225e9a35487ceaeeb0f932abf8d040b929500af6ead8c4a20098e725d102", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8fc6aa3-ba51-4f4a-9f7f-9d7e4407fd25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "99", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "39a8a8cd378dc57fcb4e91da4689f2c17cae8fde9f88c0c2ffd81c37f6700c57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68b49445-931f-4bc7-adc2-982e57768c55", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "771daada0d371847fa77539ce175eaec8d236fd506dd506c6177fd949945f3a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3ef80f3b8a443e416df08d8a60663d2b36d84c491fbed93da2dfb5995d26cb1f", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n98/396 23-11009  \n adverse impact on business continuity and hence the operation of the resident \ncoordinator system and the implementation of United Nations develo pment reform.  \n491. The Board recommends that the Administration minimize vacancies and \nensure business continuity by finalizing the guidance note on resident coordinators \nad interim, which includes an expectation that resident coordinators ad interim \nserve  for the entire tenure of the expected vacancy and the diversification of \nprofiles  of resident coordinator pool members.  \n492. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (c) Concentrated geographical representation of resident coordinators and \nresident coordinator pool members  \n \n493. The Board reviewed the geographical representation of the 113 resident \ncoordinators in position as at 31 December 2022 and noted that the geographical \nrepresentation of resident coordinators was conc entrated within 13 countries, with 42 \nresident coordinators (37 per cent) from 8 countries in the Group of Western European \nand Other States.  \n494. The Board also noted an imbalance in the geographical representation of \nresident coordinator pool members. As  at 31 December 2022, there were 189 resident \ncoordinator pool members from 69 countries, which represented only 36 per cent of \nthe total 193 Member States, and 92 of the members (49 per cent) were from the \nGroup of Western European and Other States. The B oard further reviewed the \nnationality distribution of the 189 resident coordinator pool members as at \n31 December 2022 and noted that 13 countries accounted for 97 resident coordinator \npool members (51 per cent), which was more than half of the total numbe r of \nmembers.  \n495. The Board is concerned that the concentrated geographical representation of \nresident coordinators and resident coordinator pool members may weaken the resident \ncoordinator system\u2019s ability to become more inclusive and adaptive to local \ncircumstances and to reflect diversity in implementing mandates and achieving the \ngoals of the development affairs pillar in order to prepare for a decade of action and \ndelivery for sustainable development by 2030.  \n496. The Board recommends that the Admini stration ensure recruitment on as \nwide a geographical basis as possible of resident coordinators and resident \ncoordinator pool members.   \n497. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (d) Improvements needed in resident coordinator recruitment  \n \n498. The Board reviewed the recruitment process of resident coordinator recruitment \nand noted that an applicant for a resident coordinator position must be a member of \nthe resident coordinator pool. To be a resident coordinator pool member, an applicant \nneed s to apply through the designated platform. After the candidates for the resident \ncoordinator pool submit their application for membership, the Administration uses \nthe Resident Coordinator Assessment Centre, a process coordinated by an external \nservice pro vider, to assess the candidates. During this assessment process, a list of \nconfirmed candidates is provided to the external service provider. The Administration \nreviews the assessment results from the external assessor and selects members for the \nresident coordinator pool. The Board noted that during the Resident Coordinator \nAssessment Centre assessment process, profiles of the candidates, which included \nbiographical information on the candidates, were shared with the external service \nprovider.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68b49445-931f-4bc7-adc2-982e57768c55": {"__data__": {"id_": "68b49445-931f-4bc7-adc2-982e57768c55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "71007a9a-fa16-475a-bcea-2d0be8d75c0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "e71be0c635510b2788fdeb7365b9aa01b05fe58bd5900caa5a4019be2697354b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9520c9e7-c9a4-42a3-9471-f15b49134075", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "3ef80f3b8a443e416df08d8a60663d2b36d84c491fbed93da2dfb5995d26cb1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "51de88ee-8635-4f5f-8c5c-c630b4041fa8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "452c0ae31eaee440331ed105eae5f7dcee8adb8789fd0121a7db092e41ecd6f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "771daada0d371847fa77539ce175eaec8d236fd506dd506c6177fd949945f3a3", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  99/396 \n 499. The Bo ard is of the view that as all resident coordinator positions are at the D -1 \nlevel or above, personal information relating to resident coordinator pool candidates \nshould have been kept confidential.  \n500. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that information on \nresident coordinator pool candidates is dealt with in a confidential manner.  \n501. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (e) Deficiencies in resident coordinator performance appraisal and accountability  \n \n502. The Secretary -General, in his report entitled \u201cReview of the functioning of the \nresident coordinator system: rising to the challenge and keeping the promise of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201d ( A/75/905 ), stated that \u201cstrengthened \noversight and accountability of results and compliance with General Assembly \nresolution 72/279  and the quadrennial comp rehensive policy review is another \nimportant driver of change and is key to ensuring the proper functioning of the \nresident coordinator system\u201d and that \u201cthere remain several areas where further \nchange is urgently needed, particularly as they relate to the  dual accountability \nfunction\u201d.  \n503. The Board noted that 65 of the 83 appointments of resident coordinators ad \ninterim in 2022 (78 per cent) resulted in the resident coordinator ad interim holding \nthat position for less than six months. Since the resident  coordinator performance \nmanagement system is only applicable to those who have served as resident \ncoordinator or resident coordinator ad interim for at least six months, according to \nthe management and accountability framework, there were no performance a ppraisals \nor accountability assessments for the resident coordinators ad interim who held those \n65 appointments.  \n504. The Board is concerned that, because the resident coordinator ad interim is an \nimportant role, and has delegated authority to lead the re sident coordinator office and \nthe United Nations country team with regard to the implementation of development \nreform activities, the lack of appropriate performance appraisals and accountability \nassessments of resident coordinators ad interim who are in o ffice for less than six \nmonths may affect the effectiveness of their performance.  \n505. The Board recommends that the Administration develop detailed guidelines \nto outline the steps of the performance management process to ensure \naccountability, including f or resident coordinators ad interim, regardless of the \ntenure of their appointment.  \n506. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (f) Deficiencies in the accountability structure and coordination mechanism for the \nimplementation of development reform initiatives  \n \n507. The United Nations Sustainable Development Group oversees system -wide \ncontributions to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. This mechanism should \nfunction effectively in leveraging concerted efforts and enforce a strengthened \naccountability framework to ensure every member is fully and duly committed to \ndelivering what has been agreed and signed for.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework is the \nmost important instrument for the planning and implementation of United Nations \ndevelopment activities at the country level. The Board examined the status of \nCooperation Framework implementation as at 31 December 2022 and noted backlogs \nat various stages. The backlogs included the absence of an annual performance review \nfor 46 per cen t of United Nations country teams (61 of 132); the lack of a funding \nframework for the Cooperation Framework in 32 per cent of the countries (22 of 69) \nthat reported that they had implemented the Cooperation Framework by the year \nended 2022; a significant delay (greater than nine months) in the completion of 27 \nper cent of Cooperation Framework evaluations (15 of 56) conducted in either 2021 \nor 2022 when compared with the expected time frame according to the Cooperation \nFramework evaluation guidance; incomp lete common country analyses updates for \n54 per cent of the countries (15 of 28) that began implementing the Cooperation \nFramework in 2022; and the lack of an assessment metric with regard to the United \nNations country team configuration evaluation exercis e. \n \n (ii) Insufficient progress in the implementation of efficiency efforts over the years  \n \n509. The report of the Secretary -General entitled \u201cRepositioning the United Nations \ndevelopment system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda: our promise for dignity, \nprosp erity and peace on a healthy planet\u201d ( A/72/684 -E/2018/7 ) cited a wide range of \nbusiness operation initiatives to generate efficiencies to be redeployed as part of \nprogrammes to  better support the 2030 Agenda. These core initiatives are supported \nby three enabling principles, including costing and pricing, client satisfaction and \nmutual recognition.  \n510. The Board noted that as at 31 December 2022, 26 per cent of the United Natio ns \nSustainable Development Group entities (9 of 35) had not yet signed both the client \nsatisfaction and the costing and pricing principles. Although the efficiency road map \nhad been revised in 2022 to include a target of 10 common back offices in high -\nvolu me locations to be approved or under implementation in 2022, no common back \noffice projects had been completed in 2022 and the establishment of common back \noffices was still behind schedule.  \n \n (iii) Insufficient sharing of information between United Nation s country teams and \nresident coordinators  \n \n511. The Board also noted the insufficient sharing of information between United \nNations country teams and resident coordinators. In countries where a United Nations \nSustainable Development Cooperation Framework h ad been developed between 2019 \nand 2022, only 20 per cent of United Nations country team member entities had shared \ntheir country programmes with resident coordinators for the coordinator\u2019s review and \nconfirmation by letter.  \n512. The Board is concerned tha t the backlogs in Cooperation Framework \nimplementation, the slow progress in establishing common back offices and the \ninsufficient sharing of information among resident coordinators and United Nations \ncountry teams will hinder the alignment of the developm ent system\u2019s functions and \ncapacities with the 2030 Agenda.  \n513. The Board is also of the view that the repositioning of the United Nations \ndevelopment system is a shared responsibility and that a more robust accountability \nstructure and coordination mechanism is necessary to achieve the envisaged benefits \nand reform targets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2ece363-c14d-4f71-a99d-e5f60698da97": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2ece363-c14d-4f71-a99d-e5f60698da97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e39c672f-7d7e-4c15-b13e-8cada0a652c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "20e2f6bd92d5414f73264e440b8674d0974a662f90080f515c3393bd499519f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51de88ee-8635-4f5f-8c5c-c630b4041fa8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "452c0ae31eaee440331ed105eae5f7dcee8adb8789fd0121a7db092e41ecd6f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9fc3290-7f9c-48ac-898b-b70c1ae86575", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "420c60ca3ba39afda1878967be69af37a67fdf66e35fe472a4e68cf8395fa6ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4b0c71e7bd6ccd8804be2f3a72dd22586c76bfe1871920b09815e5dd40d773c9", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  101/396 \n 514. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that the \naccountability structure and coordination mechanism under the United Nations \nSustainable Development  Group is fully functional with regard to the \nimplementation of the development reform initiatives.  \n515. The Board also recommends that the Administration assist in refining the \ndocumentation of the entire United Nations Sustainable Development Group to \nclearly define the responsible entities for key initiatives of the workplan by \nclearly identifying the main entities responsible for supporting, or monitoring \nand evaluating, each key initiative.  \n516. The Administration accepted the recommendations.  \n \n 14. Operations related to peace and security affairs  \n \n517. The restructuring of the peace and security pillar is anchored in the \nestablishment of two new Secretariat departments on 1 January 2019. The Department \nof Political and Peacebuilding Affairs combines po litical and analytical capabilities \nand expertise in areas such as electoral assistance, mediation and Security Council \naffairs with peacebuilding responsibilities, while the Department of Peace Operations \nprovides specialized capabilities in areas such as  military affairs and the rule of law. \nThe two Departments share a single political -operational structure with regional \nresponsibilities.  \n518. In its reports ( A/75/596 , A/77/7  and A/77/574 ), the Advisory Committee on \nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions raised concerns a bout the reform of the \npeace and security pillar in relation to benefits management, regional effectiveness \nand coherence, alignment with the development pillar and the continuous \nimprovement mechanism, and the services provided by UNOPS, among others. The  \nBoard followed up on those concerns and noted efforts made by the Administration \nto develop a mechanism for continuous improvement, to improve reform -related \nchange management and to enhance performance management. The Board, however, \nidentified the defic iencies in need of improvement, set out below.  \n \n (a) Progress in peace and security reform  \n \n  Weaknesses in implementation of the initiatives of peace and security reform relating \nto shared structure  \n \n519. The General Assembly, in its resolution 76/245 , requested the Secretary -General \nto continue his efforts to produce more realistic budget assumptions and accurate \nresource estimates that adapt faster to changes in mandates  and actual programme \nperformance, with a view to ensuring a greater focus on results and mandate delivery. \nIn the Secretary -General\u2019s bulletin entitled \u201cRegulations and Rules Governing \nProgramme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitorin g of \nImplementation and the Methods of Evaluation\u201d ( ST/SGB/2018/3 ), it is stated that \nthe subprogramme structure will, to the extent possible, correspond to an \norganizational unit normally at the divisional level.  \n520. The Board, however, noted that the shared structure, as one of the key initiatives \nfor peace and secu rity reform, was not duly reflected in the proposed budget \ndocuments and that there was no clear reference to a shared structure or to the \nresources needed for the successful delivery of its mandates, while the posts in the \nshared structure were still unde r the original pre -reform subprogrammes. In addition, \nthe offices in the shared structure did not have an integrated workplan, which should \nhave been integrated into the workplan of the Department of Political and \nPeacebuilding Affairs/Department of Peace Operations, nor was there a results", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9fc3290-7f9c-48ac-898b-b70c1ae86575": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9fc3290-7f9c-48ac-898b-b70c1ae86575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f8e28e2-9700-40f4-81be-f8c30ceddbb9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "4b04bec57ce4eae1971e1afb8f91a52adef374563a6484800fec2c480ae151bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2ece363-c14d-4f71-a99d-e5f60698da97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "4b0c71e7bd6ccd8804be2f3a72dd22586c76bfe1871920b09815e5dd40d773c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "170b48a3-509d-4918-8768-6e5a88f9702d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9b6cbbc7f3fb76cda03934a4e0ced17008417f7685126b121b25d6fc3f0feca7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "420c60ca3ba39afda1878967be69af37a67fdf66e35fe472a4e68cf8395fa6ef", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n102/396 23-11009  \n framework to ensure that mandates of both departments were duly integrated into \nsuch a workplan.  \n521. In response, the Administration noted that there were limits to its capacity to \nenact certain changes as, based on th e approval of the General Assembly, the funding \nstreams and mandates of the peace and security pillar remained unchanged following \nthe reform.  \n522. The Board recommends that the Administration reference the shared \nstructure under the relevant subprogramme to better reflect the reform \nstructures, and also reflect the shared structures and their mandates in relevant \nworkplans and associated performance reporting.  \n523. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (b) Mandate implementation  \n \n (i) Ensure transparency and report on activities of this nature to relevant \ngoverning bodies  \n \n524. The Board noted that upon the request of the Government of Member State \u201cI\u201d, \nthe United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) signed a memorandum of \nunders tanding in 2011 with Member State I to relocate the members of organization \n\u201cM\u201d in 2011 when organization M was listed as a foreign terrorist organization by \nmany Member States.  \n525. In 2016, the Department of Political Affairs (now the Department of Polit ical \nand Peacebuilding Affairs) received a voluntary contribution of $18 million from \nMember State \u201cA\u201d to support the relocation of the members of organization M to \nMember State \u201cB\u201d. The project was implemented by UNHCR in 2016 and 2017, and \nthe total expe nditure was $15.61 million. In addition, UNHCR advocated with the \nGovernment of Member State B to amend its existing legislative framework in order \nto widen integration prospects for organization M members and advocated for the \nissuance of identification d ocuments for them.  \n526. In 2021, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs received another \n$341,000 from Member State A to support the Government of Member State B in \nproviding permanent resident identification to the members of organization M , and \nUNHCR was again selected to implement the project. The total expenditure of the \ngrant was $340,000 and a total of 2,447 biometric identification cards for members \nof organization M were produced and delivered as of the end of 2022.  \n527. The Administr ation explained that owing to the political dimension, the then \nDepartment of Political Affairs worked closely with UNAMI and UNHCR to support \nthe political negotiations with regard to the movement of organization M members to \na new location, and thereafte r to third countries. Funds were channelled through a \ntrust fund managed by the Department of Political Affairs to support the costs related \nto the relocation process. All movement and relocation activities were implemented \nby UNHCR in line with its mandat e. Considering the complicated political \nenvironment as well as the emergency humanitarian aid needed to facilitate the \nrelocation of organization M members, the Department of Political Affairs had \nprovided the necessary assistance to facilitate the reloca tion. In addition, the then \nSpecial Representative of the Secretary -General and Head of UNAMI briefed the \nSecurity Council on relevant developments and it was the Administration\u2019s view that \nthe involvement of the Department of Political Affairs was in line  with its mandate \nand its relevant compliance standards, notably, screening against the United Nations \nSecurity Council Consolidated List, which comprises individuals and entities subject \nto measures imposed by the Security Council.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "170b48a3-509d-4918-8768-6e5a88f9702d": {"__data__": {"id_": "170b48a3-509d-4918-8768-6e5a88f9702d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9ea1650-0449-428f-a1b7-786bf08610e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9cc47f1a5737e1d06add33361bccc1c80b7b626e5c54749252fa80717df4b4ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9fc3290-7f9c-48ac-898b-b70c1ae86575", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "420c60ca3ba39afda1878967be69af37a67fdf66e35fe472a4e68cf8395fa6ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c6e25f8-87ed-4f27-9a22-fc2349d50d21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "59b9cc58c2e4a87a175406a1a6706d326796355b9c22f6c3e21a37cd5209d3db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9b6cbbc7f3fb76cda03934a4e0ced17008417f7685126b121b25d6fc3f0feca7", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  103/396 \n 528.

Considering the sensitivity of these cases, the Board \nis of the view that formal reporting needs to be m ade to relevant governing bodies to \nensure transparency.  \n529. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure transparency and \nreporting on activities of this nature to relevant governing bodies.  \n530. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (ii) Deficiencies in the selection and management of mediation experts  \n \n531. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs is the system -wide \nservice provider for dialogue and mediation assistance, and it requested UNOPS to \nestablish a mechanism tha t would provide mediation expertise on short notice to \nsenior mediators and envoys in support of peace processes. The Department maintains \nthe Standby Team of Senior Mediation Advisers in accordance with the financial \nagreements signed regarding the provis ions of the umbrella memorandum of \nunderstanding between the Secretariat and UNOPS, which administratively maintains \nand operationally supports a roster of eight full -time and several part -time senior \nmediation advisers, who are employed on UNOPS internati onal individual contractor \nagreements.  \n532. In 2022, 8 individuals were selected from the roster to serve full -time on the \nStandby Team of Senior Mediation Advisers and 10 individuals were deployed when \nexpertise could not be mobilized through the full -time team. These 18 experts were \nengaged in approximately 132 mediation support assignments; 78 per cent of these \nassignments were assigned to full -time members of the Standby Team. The Board \nthen reviewed the management of the mediation experts and noted th at the \nDepartment of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs could be more actively involved in \nthe selection and evaluation of the mediation experts.  \n533. The Board was informed that the Department of Political and Peacebuilding \nAffairs follows Secretariat po licy and guidance on the permitted uses of UNOPS as \nan implementing partner for projects, which places limits on the Department\u2019s role in \nthe selection and evaluation of mediation experts. Within the bounds of applicable \nrules, the Department provides subs tantive guidance to UNOPS in designing \nquestions for examinations and interviews and in selecting interview panels, while \nUNOPS is responsible for selecting interview panel members, assessments and \ndecisions regarding the selection of candidates. The perfo rmance of full -time Standby \nTeam experts is formally evaluated by UNOPS while the Department of Political and \nPeacebuilding Affairs provides qualitative feedback to UNOPS by sharing verbal \nfeedback. As for performance feedback for part -time experts, the De partment of \nPolitical and Peacebuilding Affairs issues a statement of \u201cno objection\u201d to confirm to \nUNOPS that the expert has delivered all requested support, at the desired quality, for \na particular assignment so UNOPS can begin the payment process.  \n534. Considering the importance and confidentiality of prevention and mediation \nprogrammes, as well as the key roles and responsibilities the experts play in mediation \nactivities, the Board is of the view that the Department of Political and Peacebuilding \nAffai rs should explore options for a more active way to participate in the selection \nand management of mediation experts within the bounds of the applicable regulatory \nframework with UNOPS by providing logistic support and backstopping functions to \nensure quali fied candidates are duly selected and evaluated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c6e25f8-87ed-4f27-9a22-fc2349d50d21": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c6e25f8-87ed-4f27-9a22-fc2349d50d21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3cee348b-1ef1-4698-9bed-019a4dfba708", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ffa249972ceb574c42f508cf85fb86794165c70f843ff5008de5317cc0b27ef7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "170b48a3-509d-4918-8768-6e5a88f9702d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9b6cbbc7f3fb76cda03934a4e0ced17008417f7685126b121b25d6fc3f0feca7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8936c85a-7885-4e06-9326-b6c59e05ffb1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "edb24e95ab0e681fdda068010ec3d24fced22c71fbe95853d58ef5edf8bcbfad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "59b9cc58c2e4a87a175406a1a6706d326796355b9c22f6c3e21a37cd5209d3db", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n104/396 23-11009  \n 535. The Board recommends that the Administration explore a more active way \nto participate in the selection and evaluation of experts of the Standby Team of \nSenior Mediation Advisers based on the current reg ulatory framework.   \n536. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Various rosters need enhancements regarding geographical representation and \ngender balance  \n \n537. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs is the leading entity of  \nthe United Nations with regard to good offices, political analysis, mediation, electoral \nassistance, peacebuilding support and political guidance. To achieve this, the \nDepartment maintains various rosters of experts for Security Council subsidiary \nbodies,  international electoral experts and mediation experts.  \n538. In a previous audit ( A/76/5 (Vol. I) ), the Board had identified the deficiencies \nin geographical representati on and gender balance of members on those three rosters. \nThe Board continued its review and noted that more proactive measures were needed. \nFor instance, as of the end of December 2022, of 1,375 experts (from 122 countries) \non the roster of international e lectoral experts, 613 (44.6 per cent) came from the 10 \nmost -represented countries. Of the 53 experts on the mediation roster, 22 (41.5 per \ncent) came from the Americas and 15 (28.3 per cent) were from Europe. The Board \nwas informed that the majority of med iation support assignments are conducted by a \nteam of full -time experts, drawn each year from the roster, with a focus on achieving \ngender parity and geographic balance within this full -time team. Of a total of 466 \nmembers on the roster of experts for Secu rity Council subsidiary bodies, 28 per cent \nwere women. Wider geographical and gender representation are expected to enhance \ndiversity, local knowledge, trust -building and gender equality, contributing to more \neffective and inclusive decision -making and en hancing the overall impact of the \nefforts of the United Nation in political and peacebuilding activities.  \n539. The Board reiterates its previous recommendation that the Administration \ntake more proactive measures to strengthen the geographical representati on and \ngender balance of the rosters of experts for Security Council subsidiary bodies, \ninternational electoral experts and mediation experts.  \n540. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (c) Peacebuilding Fund  \n \n (i) Insufficient funding may lead to liquidity risks in the Peacebuilding Fund  \n \n541. The Peacebuilding Fund has proven to be an important tool, providing for a \nflexible, responsive and focused resource at the disposal of the United Nations \nsystem. However, a significant gap remains be tween the level of funding available \nand the level of funding required to meet peacebuilding requirements. The Board \ncontinued to note the funding shortfalls in 2022.  \n542. The revenue of the Peacebuilding Fund has declined significantly over the past \nthree  years, from $234.53 million in 2020 to $173.24 million in 2022. It has raised only \n$623.26 million in three years, which is 41.6 per cent of its five -year fundraising target \nof $1.50 billion. In addition, the total of Peacebuilding Fund contributions and interest \nin 2022 amounted to $171.8 million, which failed to meet the target of $275.0 million, \nbut the approved budget for the Peacebuilding Support Office for projects funded by \nthe Peacebuilding Fund was $231.0 million, resulting in a shortfall of $59 m illion, \nleaving the cash balance of the Fund at around $56 million. The Peacebuilding Support \nOffice estimated that the cash balance will be insufficient to meet its funding targets \nand risks a decline in programmatic support in 2023 and beyond.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8936c85a-7885-4e06-9326-b6c59e05ffb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8936c85a-7885-4e06-9326-b6c59e05ffb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e591b0e-6dde-4878-972f-eff95f3f2a97", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "92e61f16a16edecdbb11b50244ec9e9825101b64f66cf90a3d4b73eae7627d33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c6e25f8-87ed-4f27-9a22-fc2349d50d21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "59b9cc58c2e4a87a175406a1a6706d326796355b9c22f6c3e21a37cd5209d3db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b11cc532-eee4-412f-a42e-1dcea608ed3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "01fbe580a2f4a7ced9d17833c0fc4a91770e748e9260b90b6f728bec898c2702", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "edb24e95ab0e681fdda068010ec3d24fced22c71fbe95853d58ef5edf8bcbfad", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  105/396 \n 543. The B oard is of the view that the shortfalls in Peacebuilding Fund contributions \nmay lead to liquidity risks and reduce funding predictability, resulting in negative \nimpacts on the delivery of mandates in relation to conflict prevention, electoral \nsupport and m ediation, among other things.  \n544. The Board recommends that the Administration develop a multi -year \nresource mobilization plan which takes into account emerging donors to raise \nfunds and prevent a liquidity crisis in the Peacebuilding Fund.  \n545. The Admin istration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (ii) Deficiencies in Peacebuilding Fund project management  \n \n546. The Board continued to note the following deficiencies in relation to the funding \nallocation and project management of Peacebuilding Fund projects:  \n (a) The percentage of annual Peacebuilding Fund approvals does not meet the \ntargets for two priority windows. In 2022, the allocation of funds to two priority \nwindows (\u201cCross -border and Regional Approaches\u201d and \u201cFacilitating Transitions\u201d) \nwas insufficient, and the actual results did not meet the predetermined target. With \nregard to those priority windows, the target has not been achieved for more than two \nyears, which may have a negative impact on the achievement of their objectives;  \n (b) There is a need for  sustained efforts to address project delays. By the end \nof November 2022, of a total of 337 ongoing projects, 107 projects with a start date \nbefore 2020 (including 2020) were \u201coff -track\u201d or had no information on project status, \naccounting for 31.75 per ce nt of the total. The Administration explained that the \nPeacebuilding Fund\u2019s design, monitoring and evaluation team continued to monitor \nthe situation and there was evidence that previously off -track projects had been \ncoming back on track during 2022. The B oard is of the view that the high percentage \nof off -track projects, as well as insufficient remedial actions to bring the project back \non track in a timely manner, may lead to the planned results of the project not being \nachieved in a full and timely manne r; \n (c) There is a lack of a standardized framework to report catalytic efforts. By \nthe end of 2022, there were 337 ongoing projects; however, 61.49 per cent of the 174 \nprojects sampled had no financial or non -financial catalytic effect. The Board is of \nthe view that the lack of clear definitions or measures to assess the catalytic effects \nof Peacebuilding Fund projects may lead to the results not being properly measured \nand reported.  \n547. The Board recommends that the Administration allocate sufficient fun ding \nto the priority windows of \u201cCross -border and Regional Approaches\u201d and \n\u201cFacilitating Transitions\u201d by adjusting procedures and, in addition, revise \nperformance targets based on the results of the initial three years of the \nPeacebuilding Fund\u2019s strategy.  \n548. The Board also recommends that the Administration enhance the system to \nregularly bring off -track projects in any given year back on track in the following \nyear; and clearly define and duly report the catalytic effects of the projects.  \n549. The Admin istration accepted the recommendations.  \n \n 15. Humanitarian affairs  \n \n550.

In response to the concerns of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and \nBudgetary Questions, the Board continued the review of the allocation of both the \ncountry -based pooled funds and the Centra l Emergency Response Fund, and the \nmonitoring over implementing partners, and noted the issues presented below.  \n \n (a) Lack of transparency in allocation of the country -based pooled funds and the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund  \n \n (i) Insufficient documentat ion on country selection for anticipatory action pilots  \n \n552. In its resolution 69/243 , the General Assembly urged Member States, the United \nNations and humanitarian organ izations to shift towards an anticipatory approach to \nprevent and reduce human suffering. In 2021, the Assembly, in its resolution 76/124 , \nagain encouraged the exploration and development of innovative and anticipatory \nmechanisms and approaches.  \n553. Since 2019, as requested by the General Assembly, the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund has taken an important role in supporting the set -up and financing of \nseveral anticipatory action pilots. The actions were taken under a rapid -response \nwindow in response to a trigger but ahead of predicted hazards, and were intended to \nprevent or reduce acute humanitarian impacts before they fully unfolded. As at \n31 December 2022, 13 countries and one thematic area (cholera) had been selected as \npilot countries or areas for anticipatory actions.  \n554. The Board reviewed the selection process for the 13 countries and one thematic \narea and noted that information supporting the Emergency Relief Coor dinator\u2019s \nselections of countries for anticipatory action pilots was not comprehensively recorded, \nespecially the consultation process relating to the Emergency Relief Coordinator\u2019s final \ndecision. In addition, the information, including on consultations w ith external \nhumanitarian agencies and key donors, for the selection of an initial 43 countries was \nnot documented, and a specific detailed rationale for the narrowing  down of the initial \n43 \u201cscale -ready\u201d countries to the longlist of 15 possible candidates  was not recorded. \nFurthermore, no supporting documents or written records were provided on the in -\nhouse consultation process that resulted in a proposed portfolio of 13 countries and one \nthematic area for the Emergency Relief Coordinator\u2019s final decision .  \n555. As a main tool for anticipatory mechanisms, anticipatory action contributes to \nproviding timely assistance to vulnerable people and mitigating the impact of crises. \nThe Board is of the view that it is of vital importance to select the countries that  are \nmost in need of assistance, and whose hazards are most predictable, in the most \ntransparent way, so that anticipatory action plays a core role. Therefore, the country \nselection process needs to be comprehensively recorded and documented to ensure \ntransparency.  \n556.

The Board reviewed the allocations for two country -based pooled funds in 2022 \nand noted that amounts totalling $186 million were granted to 121 preselected \npartners under the four reserve allocati on strategies for the two funds, representing \n95 per cent of the total amount granted to the four allocations. However, the specific \nand definite criteria for directly selecting these pre -identified and invited partners was \nnot disclosed in the allocation strategies.  \n560. The Board also noted that the average project budget under the reserve \nallocations for one fund was nearly two times that of its standard allocation. \nFurthermore, a total amount of $51 million was granted to 35 partners exclusively \nthroug h the less competitive reserve allocations under the two funds. Of the 35 \npartners, 1 was ineligible and 21 were high risk as of early April 2023. In addition, \nthe approved budgets of three projects exceeded the limits of the approved amount, \nand 12 were f ound to have critical risks in their audit reports as at 31 December 2022.  \n561. The Administration explained that findings of critical risk in audit reports did \nnot necessarily prevent a partner from receiving further funding unless a partner was \nrendered ineligible or suspended. And some of the same critical risk findings had been \nassessed as being at a medium or low risk level in subsequent audit reports.  \n562. The Board is concerned that insufficient disclosure of specific partner \npreselection criteria un der the reserve allocation may have a negative impact on the \nfunds\u2019 transparency and the stakeholders\u2019 confidence in the funds, and may increase \nfinancial and project implementation risks.  \n563. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that the g lobal \nguidelines for country -based pooled funds provide guidance on requirements for \nthe disclosure of the specific preselection criteria for partners invited to \nparticipate in the reserve allocations.  \n564. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Deficiencies in approving supplementary implementing partners under country -based \npooled funds  \n \n565. In accordance with the reserve allocation workflow specified in the operational \nhandbook for country -based pooled funds, the allocation strategy sho uld be reviewed \nby the Humanitarian Coordinator and endorsed by the relevant Advisory Board.  \n566. On a sample basis, the Board reviewed allocation strategies for four rounds of \nreserve allocations under two country -based pooled funds and noted that all th e initial \n141 preselected partners listed in four allocation strategies were reviewed by the \nHumanitarian Coordinator and endorsed by the relevant Advisory Board, and were \npublicly available on the funds\u2019 website. However, 15 partners who were not initiall y \ninvited but were allocated $8.63 million, representing 5 per cent of the four reserve \nallocations, did not go through the same approval process for the initial preselection, \nnor were their selections disclosed explicitly on the website. In addition, 1 of  the 15 \npartners was approved only by the Head of the Humanitarian Financing Unit of the \nfund without any recommendation from the cluster coordinator.  \n567. The Administration explained that the operational handbook for country -based \npooled funds in place a t the time of the allocations did not specify the required \napproval and disclosure process for selecting supplementary partners, and the actual \nprocesses followed were not the same as those for the original preselection of \npartners.  \n568. The Board is of th e view that the current reserve allocation process is a less \ncompetitive process compared with that of the standard allocation, and it is of vital \nimportance to specify clear guidance on the approval process and disclosure", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e96f2eeb-4f10-4de3-8347-5f2d52514d2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e96f2eeb-4f10-4de3-8347-5f2d52514d2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4f9d1ad9-755b-46fe-b1da-219718a93016", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "c0d6179d9b4e29d48d639d10ede2d17a80d849a6b872e348e155867ff143b999", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d370b418-0d4e-43ff-8554-2f2928383336", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "f548a7f7f3b39522e4f68e97c16533d089812e291043cd2bf5476208518c7b8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30e36635-2bdd-45d8-a179-4cbfa590f4e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "51343513540dfe7fb8c7c3cbb3fc82d3b050db1297ba1ccb02b80e0b8f98fa48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1d05945181b961ef1a2f8a999cc6cce8c20f5d689b0c49068a67185bb7eed711", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)   \n \n108/396 23-11009  \n requirements for the selection of  supplementary partners to ensure that they are best -\nplaced to deliver prioritized humanitarian actions on the ground.  \n569. The Board recommends that the Administration clarify the process of \nselecting supplementary partners outside the initial list of pre selected partners \nfor reserve allocations in relevant guidance, including but not limited to \nrequirements to document the process, and duly disclose any changes to the \ninitial list of preselected partners.  \n570. The Administration accepted the recommendatio n. \n \n (b) Oversight of implementing partners for country -based pooled funds  \n \n (i) Proportion of humanitarian pooled funds with assurance activities conducted by \nthird parties  \n \n571. The Board reviewed assurance activities for funding allocated to implementing \npartners under country -based pooled funds, the Central Emergency Response Fund, \nother specially designated contributions and programme budget projects of the Office \nfor the Coord ination of Humanitarian Affairs, and noted that assurance activities were \nonly conducted for country -based pooled funds and other specially designated \ncontribution projects.  \n572. The Administration explained that the Central Emergency Response Fund \nprojec ts were implemented and managed by United Nations agencies, which were \nresponsible for conducting assurance activities in line with their own rules and \nregulations, while programme budget projects fell under the extensive purview of the \nBoard and OIOS. The  Administration also explained that it used an array of tools to \nconduct assurance activities when assessing the work of implementing partners of \ncountry -based pooled funds, including programmatic monitoring, financial spot -\nchecking, programmatic and finan cial reporting (interim and final) and project \nauditing. The Board analysed two of these assurance activities \u2013 financial spot -\nchecking and auditing \u2013 and noted that a lower percentage of these two assurance \nactivities was conducted on funding allocated to  implementing partners of country -\nbased pooled funds in 2021 compared with other United Nations entities, as reflected \nin the Board\u2019s reports (see A/77/240 ). The Administration  further explained that this \nwas due to the nature of the two assurance activities considered and the timing of the \nproject cycle. Typically, the majority of financial spot -checks and audits for funding \nallocated by country -based pooled funds in one year a re conducted in the following \nyears.  \n573. The Board further reviewed the assurance activities conducted as at \n31 December 2022 for country -based pooled funds projects allocated in 2020, 2021 \nand 2022, and noted that the assurance expenditures sounded reaso nable. However, \nthe average percentage of assurance activities conducted by third parties for those \nthree years was lower than the total average of 77 per cent observed by the Board for \nthe year 2021, and ranged from 5 to 57 per cent.  \n574. The Administrat ion explained that the low coverage of assurance activities \nconducted by third parties could be attributed to the greater number of assurance \nactivities overall conducted on country -based pooled funds projects, as third parties \nconducted only audits.  \n (ii) Supplies procured and distributed by selected partners could not be verified  \n \n575.

On a sample basis, the Board reviewed 38 projects under three cou ntry-based \npooled funds and noted the following discrepancies between procurement and \ndistribution transactions:  \n (a) Discrepancies between the date of receipt and the distribution of goods \nwere found. For project \u201cA\u201d, according to the distribution lists p rovided by the \npartner, medicines were distributed to 14,716 beneficiaries months before the \naforesaid medicines had been procured by the partner. Similar cases were observed in \nproject \u201cB\u201d regarding meal distribution. Of a total of 504 meals, 28 per cent of the \nfresh food procured for project B (valued at $25,070) was distributed to 2,415 \nbeneficiaries months after the final receipt date, which means the food might be \nexpired; otherwise, the truthfulness of this transaction could be called into question;  \n (b) A discrepancy was found regarding procurement and the actual supplies. \nFor five sampled projects, there were discrepancies between the number of \nbeneficiaries in the accounting records and their signatures/fingerprints in distribution \nlists, with a tot al variance of 2,913 beneficiaries in the amount of $49,622. In addition, \ndistribution lists of medicines valued at $80,000 to beneficiaries from multiple areas \nprovided by the partner were nearly identical; however, the numbers of beneficiaries \nin these a reas were quite different, and ranged from 2,590 to 13,923. Furthermore, \n26,116 signatures for cash distributions of $2.89 million were similar to each other \nand were unverifiable.  \n577. The Administration relayed partners\u2019 explanations that the distributio ns before \nor after procurement were from their buffer stocks, but sufficient and appropriate \nevidence was not provided.  \n578. The Board was unable to verify the truthfulness of the aforesaid procurement \nand distribution transactions and is concerned that th e project deliverables might be \nexposed to risk, which would affect the achievement of the project objectives.  \n579. The Board recommends that the Administration highlight the potential \ndiscrepancies identified to the project auditors, conclude ongoing audi t processes \nfor the final verification of project deliverables and the determination of any \nineligible expenditures and refunds, and follow up on compliance concerns in \nline with the established procedures.  \n580. The Administration accepted the recommendati on. \n \n 16. Information and communications technology  \n \n581. As part of the management reform, the Office of Information and \nCommunications Technology plays a leading role in the strengthened governance of \nICT operations across the Secretariat, and continues to support and facilitate the \nimplementation of mandates by departments, offices and fields. Furthermore, the \nOffice identifies frontier technologies to build innovative technology solutions and \nensures information security in the face of complex cybersecu rity challenges.  \n582. In his report entitled \u201cInformation and communications technology strategy\u201d \n(A/77/489 ), the Secretary -General proposed a new ICT strategy for 2023 \u20132028 to \ndrive technology and data initiatives in the work of the United Nations. The strategic \ngoals of the new ICT strategy are to serve the United Nations en tities in their mandate \ndelivery, enable digital transformation through innovation and partnership and \nsafeguard and secure the Secretariat\u2019s information assets.  \n583.

The issues identified are \ndiscussed below.  \n \n (a) Shortcomings in the information and communication technology \ngovernance framework  \n \n584. The Board was informed that, for smoother implementation of the ICT strategy \nintroduced by the Secretary -General in his report ( A/77/489 ), the Office of \nInformation and Communications Techn ology drafted an accountability framework \nstating the responsibilities of the Office and other United Nations entities in relation \nto ICT affairs, and classified the United Nations entities as ICT -certified and ICT-\nsupported entities based on their ICT cap acity to achieve a balance between \noperational freedom and central control. Moreover, the Office refined the roles and \nresponsibilities of the decision -making bodies in the new governance framework. The \nBoard reviewed the above framework and identified the  deficiencies below that need \nfurther improvement.  \n \n (i) Lack of clarification about the balance between operational freedom and \ncentral control  \n \n585. The Board noted that there was no clearly defined guideline elaborating which \nICT activities needed to be  centrally controlled and which were to be delegated to the \nhead of entity for operational freedom. In addition, there were no standards and \nassessments methods for classifying an entity as an ICT -certified entity, which ha s \nthe ability to make decisions r egarding ICT solutions.  \n586. The Board noted that the previous ICT strategy required the Office of \nInformation and Communications Technology to oversee and monitor ICT \ninvestments, while the management reform sought to decentralize decision -making \nauthorit y. This misalignment had partly resulted in ICT fragmentation in budget, \ncybersecurity, global assets management and sourcing . \n587. The Board is concerned that the lack of a well -defined and widely accepted \nbalance between operational freedom and central c ontrol would prevent entities from \naddressing complex challenges while leveraging the strengths of both centralized \ncontrol and decentralized decision -making.  \n588. The Board recommends that the Administration clarify the balance \nbetween the Office of Infor mation and Communications Technology\u2019s central \ncontrol and the entities\u2019 operational freedom in the procurement and \nmanagement of ICT assets as part of the proposed information and \ncommunication technology accountability framework, and that the Office of \nInformation and Communications Technology should also establish standards \nand assessment methods when designating entities as ICT  certified.  \n589.

The Board continued to note that the roles and duties of the Assistant Secretary -\nGeneral, Chief Information and Technology Officer had not been clearly defined in \nthe proposed ICT governance framework even though it had been recommended in \nthe previous audit report. The ICT strategy for 2023 \u20132028 and the new ICT \ngovernance framework and accountability framework were still under consultation, \nwhich could be a good opportunity for the Administration to duly define the roles and \nduties of the Chief Information and Technology Officer with regard to ICT governance, \nstrategic planning, the management of ICT infrastructure and cybersecurity, among \nothers, ensuring the Chief Information and Technology Officer played an active role in \nmanaging the ICT budget, verifying compliance with the ICT governance and \nnormative framework, optimizing efficiencies and avoiding duplication.  \n591. The Board recommends that the Administration include a clear definition \nof the roles and duties of the Chie f Information and Technology Officer in the \nICT governance framework and accountability framework.  \n592. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (iii) Insufficient representation and performance of the information and communication \ntechnology governance bodies  \n \n593. The Board was informed that in the ICT governance framework, the key ICT \ngovernance bodies consisted of the ICT Steering Committee, the Project Review \nCommittee and four ICT technical committees, including the Architectur e Review \nBoard, the ICT Policy Committee, the Information Security Board and the \nTechnology Innovation Governance Committee.  \n594. The Board noted instances of insufficient and irrational representation of members \nin the four ICT technical committees, in th e light of their terms of reference. For \nexample, the ICT Policy Committee has a member from the Enterprise Programme \nManagement Section of the Office of Information and Communications Technology, \nwho is not required according to the terms of reference, an d a representative from the \nOffice of the Administration of Justice, which is not a substantive office that has a \nsignificant reliance on ICT. Such insufficient and irrational representation may lead to \nrisks of lack of inclusiveness, inadequate understand ing of user needs, limited \nstakeholder buy -in and ineffective decision -making .  \n595. The Board also noted the infrequent convening of the ICT Policy Committee, \nthe Information Security Board and the Technology Innovation Governance \nCommittee as required in  the terms of reference, which might result in untimely \ndecision -making, reduced coordination and communication, missed opportunities for \nimprovement and a lack of accountability and oversight, among other things. In 2022, \nthe ICT Policy Committee and the Technology Innovation Governance Committee \nwere required to meet monthly, but these committees only held five meetings and one \nmeeting, respectively, while the Information Security Board, which was required to \nmeet quarterly, held only one meeting.  \n596. The Board recommends that the Administration review the membership of \nthe ICT governance bodies to ensure sufficient and appropriate representation \nin the committees and ensure that the ICT governance bodies meet at the \nrequired frequency, in accordance with  their terms of reference.  \n597.

In its resolution 69/262 , the General Assembly un derlined the importance of \nhaving strong and accountable management of information security. The Office of \nInformation and Communications Technology made some efforts to enhance the \nmanagement of information security by improving global visibility and over sight in \n2022. At the same time, the Office implemented initiatives of the seven -point \ncybersecurity action plan and established proactive threat -hunting capabilities to \nreduce the occurrence of security incidents and minimize negative impacts. However, \nthe Board noted the following deficiencies in cybersecurity, set out below.  \n \n (i) Insufficient visibility of cybersecurity at entities across the Secretariat  \n \n599. The full visibility of cybersecurity is crucial for a concerted effort towards \nprotecting sensitive information, preserving organizational effectiveness, addressing \ncybersecurity challenges and exerting leadership and influence in the realm of \ncybersecurity. In this regard, the Board noted the following areas for improvement:  \n (a) There was insufficient visibility of the number of websites and \napplications. In 2022, 769 websites and 889 applications accomplished self -\ncertification across the United Nations entities; however, the Office of Information \nand Communications Technology was unable to capture the total number of websites \nand applications due to some entities not completing the self -certification process;  \n (b) There was insufficient visibility regarding security assessments. The \nBoard noted that the Office had not conducted suf ficient and comprehensive security \nassessments across the United Nations entities. For example, the infrastructure and \napplications hosted by the entities themselves could not be assessed by the Office \nowing to the lack of required access. The Board also n oted that seven United Nations \nentities had two or more security incidents in 2022 and that 294 vulnerabilities were \nfound by the public across the United Nations accessible information systems, 61 of \nwhich were high -risk;  \n (c) There was insufficient visib ility related to the implementation of disaster \nrecovery plans. The Board noted that although the Office could follow the status of \nthe disaster recovery plans of various entities based on the self -reporting mechanisms \nthrough Unite apps, it had limited au thority to supervise entities in their performance \nof disaster recovery exercises annually, as required in its disaster recovery planning \ntechnical procedure.  \n600. The Board is concerned that insufficient visibility of overall cybersecurity \nacross the Secr etariat runs the risk of security challenges going undetected, not being \nduly addressed or sufficiently reported, and does not facilitate lessons learned.  \n601. The Board recommends that the Administration define the specific areas of \ncybersecurity that ne ed to be accountable to a central governance function, and \nencourage all entities to participate in global cybersecurity initiatives to increase \nvisibility of and strengthen cybersecurity.   \n602. The Administration accepted the recommendation.  \n \n (ii) Insuff icient capacity in relation to cybersecurity management  \n \n603. Cybersecurity management capacity is important to protect data and assets, \nprevent cyberattacks, comply with regulations, ensure business continuity, protect \nstakeholders, maintain reputation an d trust, manage risks proactively and support \ndigital transformation. It is a strategic imperative in order for organizations to operate \nsecurely and thrive in an increasingly interconnected world that faces cyberthreats. \nIn this regard, the Board noted th e following deficiencies:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1647a07-5925-45ad-bf02-f9e582f89b0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1647a07-5925-45ad-bf02-f9e582f89b0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df9b1bbb-e221-4f07-8165-3f0413dd061e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "5bb100f444dbf4ff7e8dffb8d88b59c8e501e7c8aff69d774f6ee16b83987aa0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb58b3e7-3ab3-4340-ab40-241198429757", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "6723c4c2b2fd42315e3badb30cc021437fd75346d9acbb988b9878e8ba98aff2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61d49d15-b992-420b-8760-5ecbcf7a05fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "cc4896aa2973a5e2d39ff248a384c1b945427b68f8cffbbc50ff08727ed54583", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "284d905b99fe51dc0792965f5623a4852640c527262546ab210fa053c6ff4874", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  113/396 \n  (a) The deployment of security tools was not accomplished. The Board \nreviewed the progress of the seven -point cybersecurity action plan in 2022 and noted \nthat 18 of 35 entities across the Secretariat had not established network s egmentation. \nIn addition, 22 entities across the Secretariat still needed to deploy the threat -hunting \nsolution, which is a project aimed at strengthening capabilities to proactively address \nthreats;  \n (b) There is no comprehensive workforce plan for cybers ecurity. The Office \nof Information and Communications Technology required 18 positions in the capital \ninvestment plan to reinforce the cybersecurity capacities across 10 locations of the \nSecretariat. However, the Office had no explanation of how the posts related to the \ndetailed working objectives and how the posts would fill gaps in cybersecurity, as \ndifferent locations may have different needs.  \n604. The Board also noted the following cybersecurity incidents that needed to be \nbrought to the forefront:  \n (a) A distributed denial -of-service attack occurred against the homepage of \nthe United Nations, which caused intermittent unavailability of the site in June 2022;  \n (b) The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Co ngo was infected by malware six times through compromised \nassets during 2022;  \n (c) The global and long -term impacts of exposed accounts are a risk to \nsecurity across the United Nations entities.  \n605. The Board is of the view that a clear and comprehensiv e plan for the deployment \nof security tools and software would allow the Organization to have a better \nunderstanding of the resources needed with respect to personnel, technology and \nservices.  \n606. The Board is unsure whether the current cybersecurity cap acity and strength are \nsufficient to protect the Organization from security incidents, given the growing scale \nand complexity of cyberattacks targeting the United Nations.  \n607. The Board recommends that the Administration develop a workplan for the \nresourc es needed with respect to personnel and technology for the full \nimplementation of network segmentation and the threat -hunting solution.  \n608.

This recommendation is related to the \nrecommendation in chapter II, \nparagraph 243, of A/77/5 (Vol. I) , \nwhich relates to the review of useful \nlives and fully depreciated assets. The \nBoard raised the subsequent \nrecommendation after performing a \nthorough review of the current \ndepreciation policie s of the \nOrganization. Therefore, the present \nrecommendation has been superseded \nby the subsequent recommendation \nand should therefore be closed.  Given that the new \nrecommendation in chapter \nII, paragraph  243, of A/77/5 \n(Vol. I)  and the present \nrecommendation both require \na more appropriate \nassessment on the useful life \nof assets, and there are clear \nsteps to implement the new \nrecommendation, the Board \nconsider this \nrecomme ndation to have \nbeen overtaken by events.

The Administration requests closure \nof this recommendations as  no \nsignificant discrepancies were \nobserved during the audit of the \ncensus data. The Administration is \ncontinuously working on improving \nchecks on and validation of the data \nused for the census.  All active staff \nrecords now come from a single data \nsource, Umoja, with only a fraction \nof records coming from the United \nNations Development Programme \n(UNDP) for United Nations staff who \nare administered by that agency. Data \nprovided by UNDP is of robust \nquality as well and is an extract from \nthe central e nterprise resource \nplanning system of the agency.  Given that the \nAdministration is \ncontinuously working on \nimproving checks on and \nvalidation of the data used \nfor the census and that all \nactive staff records now \ncome from a single data \nsource, Umoja, with only a \nfraction of records coming \nfrom UNDP for United \nNations staff who are \nadministered by that \nagency, the Board considers \nthis recommendation \nimplemented.

Since 2019, the Administration has \nintroduced eight new recruitment tools \nto support heads of entity in the \nefficient exercise of their delegated \nauthority for recruitment and meet the \n120-day target to fill vacant posts. In \n2022, the  timeline for selections \naveraged 156 days (a  16 per cent \nimprovement compared with 185 days \nin 2021) based on 2,333 selections \nrecorded in Inspira.

Introduction  \n \n \n1. The Secretary -General has the honour to submit the financial report on the \nvolume I set of accounts of the United Nations for the year ended 31 December 2022.  \n2. The financial situation of the Organization is presented in five financial statements \nand the acco mpanying notes that provide financial information relating to the United \nNations General Fund and related funds, trust funds, the Tax Equalization Fund, capital \nassets and construction -in-progress funds, end -of-service/post -employment benefits  \nfunds, insur ance/workers\u2019 compensation and other funds.  \n3. The financial statements presented herein as the volume I set of accounts do not \ninclude peacekeeping operations and the International Residual Mechanism for \nCriminal Tribunals, which are reported on separate ly. Separate financial statements \nare also issued for the International Trade Centre (ITC), the United Nations \nUniversity, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, the United Nations \nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Envi ronment Programme \n(UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN -Habitat).  \n4.

It presents an overview of the consolidated positio n \nand performance of the Organization\u2019s operations, highlighting trends and significant \nmovements.  \n \n \n B. Governance  \n \n \n5. The operations of the United Nations Secretariat are governed by the General \nAssembly in its role as lead organ for the financial and administrative aspects of the \nUnited Nations. The core operations of the Secretariat are funded through the regular \nbudget, which has a unique scale of assessments and is subject to a budgetary process \nmandated by the Assembly, by trust funds established b y the Assembly or the \nSecretary -General, which supplement the activities of the regular budget, or by \nspecial accounts or funds established to facilitate mandate implementation by the \nSecretary -General in his role as Chief Administrative Officer of the Uni ted Nations.  \n6. The General Assembly plays a key role in the financing of the regular budget \noperations, which accounts for approximately half of the total expenses as reported \nin the volume I set of accounts. The Assembly approves budget appropriations, w hich \nare apportioned on all Member States on the basis of the scale of assessments for the \nregular budget. The Assembly, through its Administrative and Budgetary Committee \n(Fifth Committee), approves and oversees the regular budget. This includes how the \nparts and sections of the regular budget are funded on the basis of the proposed \nprogramme budget submitted by the Secretary -General.  \n7.

Nonetheless, intra -year \ncollections continue to fluctuate significantly each year, causing uncertainty  for safe \nspending. In 2022, larger collections were received in December than in November, \nwhich was a reversal from the pattern of collections in 2021, where larger collections \nwere received in November rather than in December. Late collection increases \nuncertainty and the potential for delayed year -end spending. Cash receipts trailed \nestimates significantly for most of the year but finally the total collections exceeded \nthe estimates for the year towards the year end. Such a delayed pattern in collection s \nduring 2022 warranted the need for the regular budget to borrow from the Working \nCapital Fund in the amount of $149.9 million in September 2022, with subsequent \nrepayment in December.  \n9.

The realized rate of return i n \nthe main pool was 1.57 per cent (2021: 0.41 per cent).

The unrealized loss for 2022 was due to the historically \nsharp rise in interest rates during the period and the corresponding reduced mark -to-\nmarket value of the investment positions at the financial year  end.

The going -concern assertion is based on the app roval by the General Assembly \nof the regular budget appropriations for 2023 in resolution 77/264 , the positive \nhistorical trend of collection of assessed and voluntary con tributions over the past \nyears and the fact that the Assembly has taken no decision to cease the operations of \nthe United Nations.  \n \n  Authorization for issue  \n \n11.

The United Nations operational rates \nof exchange approximate the spot rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At \nyear end, monetary ass ets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are \ntranslated at the United Nations operational rates of exchange. Non -monetary foreign \ncurrency -denominated items that are measured at fair value are translated at the \nUnited Nations operational rate of exchange at the date on which the fair value was \ndetermined. Non -monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are \nnot translated at year end.  \n15.

Materiality is central to the preparation and presentation of the Organization\u2019s \nfinancial statements and its materiality framework provides a systematic method in \nguiding accounting decisions relating to presentation, disclosure, aggregation, \noffset ting and retrospective versus prospective application of changes in accounting \npolicies. In general, an item is considered material if its omission or its aggregation \nwould have an impact on the conclusions or decisions of the users of the financial \nstatem ents.  \n17. Preparing financial statements in accordance with IPSAS requires use of \nestimates, judgments and assumptions in the selection and application of accounting \npolicies and in the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and \nexpense s.  \n18. Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \nbasis and revisions to estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimates are \nrevised and in any future year affected. Significant estimates and assumptions that \nmay result in material adjustments in future years include: actuarial measurement of \nemployee benefits; selection of useful lives and the depreciation/amortization \nmethods for property, plant and equipment/intangible assets; impairment of assets; \nclassificat ion of financial instruments; valuation of inventory; inflation and discount \nrates used in the calculation of the present value of provisions; and classification of \ncontingent assets/liabilities.  \n \n  Future accounting pronouncements  \n \n19. The progress and impact of the following significant future IPSAS Board \naccounting pronouncements on the Organization\u2019s financial statements continue to be \nmonitored:  \n (a) Heritage assets: the objective of the project is to develop accounting \nrequirements for heritage ass ets;  \n (b) Infrastructure assets: the objective of the project is to research and identify \nissues preparers have when applying IPSAS 17: Property, plant and equipment, to \ninfrastructure assets. Informed by this research, the aim is to provide additional \nguidance on accounting for infrastructure assets. The IPSAS Board plans to issue a \nnew standard on property, plant and equipment replacing IPSAS 17, adding public \nsector guidance on heritage and infrastructure assets and aligning with the new \nmeasurement pri nciples.

The related section  \nof the Conceptual Framework for General Purpose Financial Reporting by Public \nSector Entities, chapter 7, on the measurement of assets and liabilities, will also be \nupdated in line with the new standard;  \n (d) Non-exchange expenses: the aim of the project is to develop a standard or \nstandards that provide recognition and measurement requirements applicable to \nproviders of non -exchange transactions, except for social benefits. The new standard \nwould result in a change in accounting policy for the recognition  of expenses whereby \nthe transfer provider will recognize an expense when the transfer recipient satisfies \nan obligation by transferring goods or services to a third -party beneficiary.

The  \nIPSAS Board finished discussing principle -related issues and plans to issue the \nstandard in the first half of 2023;  \n (f) \u201cAccounting and reporting by retirement benefit plans\u201d is a new project of \nthe IPSAS Board and an adaptation of International Accounti ng Standards 26. The \nobjective of developing the exposure draft is to prescribe the accounting and reporting \nrequirements for public sector retirement benefit plans, which primarily provide \nbenefits to retired public sector employees. A retirement benefit plan that prepares \nand presents financial statements under the accrual basis of accounting shall apply \nthis guidance;  \n (g) \u201cOther lease -type arrangements\u201d is another new project of the Board, with \nthe aim of developing additional guidance for identifying and addressing lease -related \naccounting issues associated with lease -type arrangements.

The impact of these standards on the Organization\u2019s financial statements and the \ncomparative period therein has b een evaluated to be as follows:  \n \nStandard  Anticipated impact in the year of adoption  \n  IPSAS 41  IPSAS 41: Financial instruments, substantially improves the relevance of information \nfor financial assets and financial liabilities. It will replace IPSAS 29: Financial \ninstruments: recognition and measurement, and improves that Standard\u2019s \nrequirements by introducing:  \n(a) Simplified classification and measurement requirements for financial assets;  \n(b) A forward -looking impairment model;  \n(c) A flexible hedge accounting model.  \nCompliance with IPSAS 41: Financial instruments, is mandatory for the volume I \nfinancial year ending 31 December 2023. The Organization is in the process of \nassessing the new requirements for recording, valuation and reporting of the \ninvestment cash pools in line with IPSAS 41. The assessment results will be used to \ndevelop an accoun ting policy document and update the Corporate Guidance.  \nIPSAS 42  IPSAS 42: Social benefits, provides guidance on accounting for social benefits \nexpenditure. It defines social benefits as cash transfers paid to specific individuals \nand/or households to mitigate the effect of social risk. Specific examples include \nState r etirement benefits, disability benefits, income support and unemployment \nbenefits. The new standard requires an entity to recognize an expense and a liability \nfor the next social benefit payment.  \nCurrently, there are no such social benefits applicable to the Organization, and hence \nthe standard will have no impact on the volume I financial reporting.  \nIPSAS 43  IPSAS 43: Leases, replaced IPSAS 13: Leases aligning guidance with International \nFinancial Reporting Standard 16. The newly issued standard introduc es new contract \nand leases definitions and prescribes a right -of-use recognition and measurement \nmodel for all leases apart from those meeting short -term and low -value exemption \ncategories. IPSAS 43 also provides additional guidance on the application of t he risks \nand rewards model for lessor accounting. Adoption of the standard is mandatory for \nthe volume I financial year ending 31 December 2025. The impact of IPSAS 43 will \nbe assessed over the 2023 and 2024 calendar years prior to the 1 January 2025 \neffec tive date. The broadened leases definition is estimated to result in the \nrecognition of more binding arrangements as leases, with a corresponding increase in \nlease liabilities and right -of-use assets.  \nIPSAS 44  IPSAS 44: Non -current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, promulgates \naccounting for assets held for sale and the presentation and disclosure requirements of \ndiscontinued operations, in alignment with International Financial Reporting Standard 5. \nAdoption of the standard is manda tory for the Vol. I financial year ending 31 December \n2025. The impact of IPSAS 44 will be assessed to prepare the Organization for its \nimplementation prior to the 1 January 2025 effective date. Given the definitions and \nscope of non -current assets held fo r sale, the recognition and measurement impacts are \npreliminarily estimated as not significant for the Organization, as the presentation and \ndisclosure changes will depend on the identification of discontinued operations, if any, \nin the future, starting on  1 January 2025.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34789649-ad82-4231-b05b-f116ee810625": {"__data__": {"id_": "34789649-ad82-4231-b05b-f116ee810625", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ce2d3b7-35df-4edb-99cf-246d53899643", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "2d396cc38414861bf221f929c1821722743300b59bfe5f1a9c781b53cea556ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45e87a36-880a-43f9-b4d2-fca445ca6db5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "300", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "bc7c61aa6f19f56667efbbb5f5e790c7575e6345baedf69122b59f47248f44e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db599fc1-3309-406a-b0f4-0d574aadfa8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "c3a3ac90e625b6d1b0342e68486f91897626237d1b8ba8ba734a85d679512a46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ba4efea98933a56a8d8b43ce2dd6a2b42dc450bb578ec7ed9a7685c181d8b424", "text": "Operations of the United Nations as reported in volume I  \nNotes to the financial statements  (continued)  A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  299/396 \n   Note 3  \n  Significant accounting policies  \n \n  Financial assets classification  \n \n22. The classification of financial assets depends primarily on the purpose for which \nthe financial assets are acquired. The Organization classifies its financial assets in \none of the categories shown below at initial recognition and re -evaluates the \nclassification at each reporting date.  \n \nClassification  Financial assets  \n  Fair value through \nsurplus or deficit  Investments in cash pools and the United Nations Staff \nMutual Insurance Society against Sickness and \nAccidents  \nLoans and receivables  Cash and cash equivalents and receivables  \n \n \n23. All financial assets are initially measured at fair value. The Organization \ninitially recognizes financial assets classified as loans and receivables on the date on \nwhich they originated. All other financial assets are recognized initially on the trade \ndate, which is the date on which the Organization becomes party to the contractual \nprovisions of the instrument.  \n24. Financial assets with maturities in excess of 12 months at the reporting date are \ncategorized as non -current assets in the financial statemen ts. Assets denominated in \nforeign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the United Nations \noperational rates of exchange prevailing at the reporting date, with net gains or losses \nrecognized in surplus or deficit in the statement of finan cial performance.  \n25. Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are those that have been \ndesignated in this category at initial recognition, are held for trading or are acquired \nprincipally for the purpose of selling in the short term. The se assets are measured at \nfair value at each reporting date, and any gains or losses arising from changes in the \nfair value are presented in the statement of financial performance in the year in which \nthey arise.  \n26. Loans and receivables are non -derivativ e financial assets with fixed or \ndeterminable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are initially \nrecorded at fair value, plus transaction costs, and are subsequently reported at \namortized cost calculated using the effective interest metho d. Interest revenue is \nrecognized on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method on the \nrespective financial asset.  \n27. Financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there \nis objective evidence of impairmen t. Evidence of impairment includes default or \ndelinquency of the counterparty or permanent reduction in the value of the asset. \nImpairment losses are recognized in the statement of financial performance in the \nyear in which they arise.  \n28. Financial asset s are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows have \nexpired or have been transferred and the Organization has transferred substantially \nall risks and rewards of the financial asset.

Standard rates ranging from 2 per cent to 40 per cent of the \ncost of purchase, depending on the location of each o ffice and mission, are used in \nplace of actual associated costs;  \n (c) Owing to the absence of historical cost information, buildings and \ninfrastructure real estate assets were initially recognized at fair value using a \ndepreciated replacement cost methodo logy for initial IPSAS implementation. The \nmethod involves calculating the cost per unit of measurement, for example cost per \nsquare metre, by collecting construction cost data, utilizing in -house cost data (where \navailable) or using external cost estimato rs for each catalogue of real estate assets and \nmultiplying that unit cost by the external area of the asset to obtain the gross \nreplacement cost. Depreciation allowance deductions from the gross replacement cost \nto account for physical, functional and eco nomic use of the assets have been made to \ndetermine the depreciated replacement cost of the assets. With the exception of real \nestate assets located in the special political missions, any subsequent real estate \nadditions are recognized at historical cost. Effective January 2018, new constructions \nin the special political missions were recognized at historical cost;  \n (d) With regard to property, plant and equipment acquired at nil or nominal \ncost, including donated assets, the fair value at the date of acqu isition is deemed to \nbe the cost to acquire equivalent assets.  \n42. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives \nusing the straight -line method up to their residual value, except for land and assets \nunder construction, wh ich are not subject to depreciation.

In exceptional cases, the recorded useful lives for some assets converted for \nIPSAS reporting may be different from the useful lives prescribed at the asset subclass \nlevel as set out above (although it would remain within the range at the asset class \nlevel), because when preparing the 2014 IPSAS opening balance a thorough review \nof the remaining economic useful lives for these assets was made and the result had \nbeen entered in the master record of the asset. A lthough the total useful life entered \nin the asset master record looks beyond standard useful life, the remaining useful life \nwhen calculated from the date of capitalization remains within the asset class \nprescribed range. The useful lives applied for the Vienna International Centre \nbuildings are based on the valuation report, which was agreed upon by the Vienna -\nbased organizations with some components\u2019 lives extending up to 100 years.  \n44. Where there is a material cost value of fully depreciated assets tha t are still in \nuse, adjustments to accumulated depreciation are incorporated into the financial \nstatements to reflect a residual value of 10 per cent of historical cost based on an \nanalysis of the classes and useful lives of the fully depreciated assets.  \n45. Following recommendations of the Board of Auditors to review the useful lives \nof all classes of assets, the Organization carried out a system -wide survey with the \nsupport of the Task Force on Accounting Standards and analysed its own historical \ndata on asset utilization, resulting in the revision of useful lives. The updated useful \nlives will be applied to the Organization\u2019s property plant and equipment prospectively \nstarting 1 January 2023.  \n46. The Organization chose the cost model for measurement of p roperty, plant and \nequipment after initial recognition instead of the revaluation model. Costs incurred \nsubsequent to initial acquisition are capitalized only when it is probable that future \neconomic benefits or service potential associated with the item w ill flow to the \nOrganization and the subsequent cost exceeds the threshold for initial recognition. \nRepairs and maintenance are expensed in the statement of financial performance in \nthe year in which they are incurred.  \n47. A gain or loss resulting from th e disposal or transfer of property, plant or \nequipment arises when proceeds from disposal or transfer differ from its carrying \namount. Those gains or losses are recognized in the statement of financial \nperformance as part of other revenue or other expenses .  \n48. Impairment assessments are conducted during annual physical verification \nprocedures and when events or changes in circumstance indicate that carrying amounts \nmay not be recoverable. Land, buildings and infrastructure assets with a year -end \nnet- book -value greater than $500,000 per unit are reviewed for impairment at each \nreporting date. The equivalent threshold for other property, plant and equipment items \n(excluding assets under construction and leasehold improvements) is $25,000.  \n \n  Intangible ass ets  \n \n49. Intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and \naccumulated impairment loss. For intangible assets acquired at nil or nominal cost, \nincluding donated assets, the fair value at the date of acquisition is deemed to be the \ncost of the asset. The thresholds for recognition are $100,000 per unit for internally \ngenerated intangible assets and $20,000 per unit for externally acquired intangible \nassets.  \n50. Acquired computer software licences are capitalized on the basis of the c osts \nincurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.

Where a donated right -to-use arrangement is treated as an operating lease, an \nexpense and corresponding revenue equal to the annual rental value of the asset or \nsimilar property are recognized in the financial statements. Where a donated right -to-\nuse arrangement is treated as a finance lease (principally with a lease term of over \n35 years for premises), the fair market value of the property is capitalized and \ndepreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the property or the te rm of the \narrangement. In addition, a liability for the same amount is recognized, which is \nprogressively recognized as revenue over the lease term. Donated right -to-use land \narrangements are accounted for as operating leases where the Organization does no t \nhave exclusive control over the land and/or title to the land is transferred under \nrestricted deeds.  \n61. Where title to land is transferred to the Organization without restrictions, the \nland is accounted for as donated property, plant and equipment and recognized at fair \nvalue at the acquisition date.  \n62. The threshold for the recognition of revenue and expense is a yearly rental value \nequivalent of $20,000 per unit for donated right -to-use premises and $5,000 per unit \nfor machinery and equipment.  \n \n  Employee benefits  \n \n63. Employees comprise staff members, as described under Article 97 of the Charter \nof the United Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship with the \nOrganization are defined by a letter of appointment subject to regulations \npromulgated by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the \nCharter. Employee benefits are classified into short -term benefits, long -term benefits, \npost-employment benefits and termination benefits.  \n \n  Short -term employee benefits  \n \n64. Short -term employee benefits are employee benefits (other than termination \nbenefits) that are payable within 12 months after the end of the year in which the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ac13856-a25c-43f3-a58f-5966ba421566": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ac13856-a25c-43f3-a58f-5966ba421566", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "309", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f76055ce-6586-4c66-a848-4a6505cf6828", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "309", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "8aad9b455cbfd4067b6b0525c8302bf40328c107bcb876042fe94a5c44f9e222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd3f4dff-59a3-4360-a298-ebfac2ac2ae1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "308", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ace144e392879273da38cfca86dcade29fd0ab54e1eb3ebe55c562e54c306040", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34bda5c6-ca15-4b8c-968e-542e17006b51", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "310", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "55e2a7b27609e8f61328ce178fe8b951b47272e221e0c5d0363c4811f3c000f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "af1118ea434b55f2c4e47d32efea3cf8587a050f1b34922dc7ee01272793c146", "text": "Operations of the United Nations as reported in volume I  \nNotes to the financial statements  (continued)  A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  307/396 \n employee renders the related services. Short -term employee bene fits comprise first -\ntime employee benefits (assignment grants), regular daily/weekly/monthly benefits \n(wages, salaries and allowances), compensated absences (paid sick leave and \nmaternity/paternity leave) and other short -term benefits (death grant, educati on grant, \nreimbursement of taxes and home leave travel) provided to current employees on the \nbasis of services rendered. All such benefits that are accrued but not paid at the \nreporting date are recognized as current liabilities within the statement of fin ancial \nposition.  \n \n  Post -employment benefits  \n \n65. Post-employment benefits comprise after -service health insurance, end -of-\nservice repatriation benefits and a pension through the United Nations Joint Staff \nPension Fund.  \n \n  Defined -benefit plans  \n \n66. The following benefits are accounted for as defined -benefit plans: after -service \nhealth insurance, repatriation benefits (post -employment benefits) and accumulated \nannual leave that is commuted to cash upon separation from the Organization (other \nlong -term benefits). Defined -benefit plans are those where the Organization\u2019s \nobligation is to provide agreed benefits and therefore the Organization bears the \nactuarial risks. The liability for defined -benefit plans is measured at the present value \nof the defined -benefit obligation. Changes in the liability for defin ed-benefit plans, \nexcluding actuarial gains and losses, are recognized in the statement of financial \nperformance in the year in which they occur. The Organization has chosen to recognize \nchanges in the liability for defined -benefit plans from actuarial gai ns and losses directly \nthrough the statement of changes in net assets. As at the end of the reporting year, the \nOrganization held no plan assets as defined by IPSAS 39: Employee benefits.  \n67. The defined -benefit obligations are calculated by independent a ctuaries using \nthe projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined -benefit obligation \nis determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using the interest \nrates of high -quality corporate bonds with maturity dates approximating those of the \nindividual plans.  \n68. After -service health insurance . Worldwide coverage for medical expenses of \neligible former staff members and their dependants is provided through after -service \nhealth insurance. Upon end of service, staff members and the ir dependants may elect \nto participate in a defined -benefit health insurance plan of the United Nations, \nprovided that they have met certain eligibility requirements, including 10 years of \nparticipation in a United Nations health plan for those who were re cruited after 1 July \n2007 and 5 years for those recruited before that date. The after -service health insurance \nliability represents the present value of the share of the Organization\u2019s medical \ninsurance costs for retirees and the post -retirement benefit ac crued to date by active \nstaff. A factor in the after -service health insurance valuation is to consider \ncontributions from all plan participants in determining the Organization\u2019s residual \nliability. Contributions from retirees are deducted from the gross li ability together with \na portion of the contributions from active staff to arrive at the Organization\u2019s residual \nliability in accordance with cost -sharing ratios authorized by the General Assembly.  \n69. Repatriation benefits . Upon end of service, staff who meet certain eligibility \nrequirements, including residency outside their country of nationality at the time of \nseparation, are entitled to a repatriation grant, which is based upon length of service, \nand travel and removal expenses.

Annual leave . The liabilities for annual leave represent unused accumulated \nleave days that are proje cted to be settled via a monetary payment to employees upon \ntheir separation from the Organization. The United Nations recognizes as a liability \nthe actuarial value of the total accumulated unused leave days of all staff members, \nup to a maximum of 60 days  (18 days for temporary staff) as at the date of the \nstatement of financial position. The methodology applies a last -in-first-out \nassumption in the determination of the annual leave liabilities, whereby staff members \naccess current period leave entitlement s before they access accumulated annual leave \nbalances relating to prior periods. Effectively, the accumulated annual leave benefit \nis accessed more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the \nbenefit arose and, overall, there is an i ncrease in the level of accumulated annual leave \ndays, pointing to the commutation of accumulated annual leave to a cash settlement \nat end of service as the true liability of the Organization. The accumulated annual \nleave benefit reflecting the outflow of economic resources from the Organization at \nend of service is therefore classified under the category of other long -term benefits, \nwhile noting that the portion of the accumulated annual leave benefit that is expected \nto be settled via monetary payment wit hin 12 months after the reporting date is \nclassified as a current liability. In line with IPSAS 39: Employee benefits, other long -\nterm benefits must be valued similarly to post -employment benefits; therefore, the \nUnited Nations values its accumulated annua l leave benefit liability as a defined, post -\nemployment benefit that is actuarially valued.  \n \n  Pension plan: United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund  \n \n71. The Organization is a member organization participating in the United Nations \nJoint Staff Pension Fu nd, which was established by the United Nations General \nAssembly to provide retirement, death, disability and related benefits to employees. \nThe Pension Fund is a funded, multi -employer defined -benefit plan. As specified in \narticle 3 (b) of the Regulations  of the Fund, membership in the Fund shall be open to \nthe specialized agencies and to any other international, intergovernmental \norganization which participates in the common system of salaries, allowances and \nother conditions of service of the United Nati ons and the specialized agencies.  \n72. The plan exposes participating organizations to actuarial risks associated with \nthe current and former employees of other organizations participating in the Fund, \nwith the result that there is no consistent and reliab le basis for allocating the \nobligation, plan assets and costs to individual organizations participating in the plan. \nThe Fund and the Organization, in line with the other participating organizations in \nthe Fund, are not in a position to identify the Organi zation\u2019s proportionate share of the \ndefined -benefit obligation, the plan assets and the costs associated with the plan with \nsufficient reliability for accounting purposes. Hence, the Organization has treated this \nplan as if it were a defined contribution p lan in line with the requirements of IPSAS 39 : \nEmployee benefits. The Organization\u2019s contributions to the Fund during the financial \nperiod are recognized as expenses in the statement of financial performance.  \n \n  Termination benefits  \n \n73. Termination bene fits are recognized as an expense only when the Organization \nis demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal \ndetailed plan to either terminate the employment of a staff member before the normal \nretirement date or provide  termination benefits as a result of an offer made in order \nto encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits to be settled within \n12 months are reported at the amount expected to be paid.

Other long -term employee benefit obligations are benefits, or portions of \nbenefits, that are not due to be settled within 12 months after the end of the year in \nwhich employees provide the related service. Accumulated annual leave is an example \nof long -term employee benefits.  \n75. Appendix D to the Staff Rules of the United Nations governs compensation in \nthe event of death, injury or illness attributable to the performance of official duties \non behalf of the United Nations. These liabilities are valued by actuaries.  \n \n  Provisions  \n \n76. Provisions are liabilities recognized for future expenditure of uncertain amount \nor timing. A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Organization \nhas a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is \nprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. \nThe amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenditure expected to be \nrequired to settle the present obligation at the re porting date. Where the effect of the \ntime value of money is material, the provision is the present value of the amount \nrequired to settle the obligation.  \n77. Uncommitted balances of the appropriations at the end of the budget period and \nexpired balances o f appropriations retained from prior periods are to be reported as \nprovisions for credits to Member States. These provisions will remain until the \nGeneral Assembly decides the manner of their disposal.  \n \n  Contingent liabilities  \n \n78. Any possible obligati ons that arise from past events and whose existence will be \nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non -occurrence of one or more uncertain future \nevents not wholly within the control of the Organization are disclosed as contingent \nliabilities. Contingent liab ilities are also disclosed where present obligations that arise \nfrom past events cannot be recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of \nresources embodying economic benefits or service potential will be required to settle \nthe obligations, or th e amount of the obligations cannot be reliably measured.  \n79. Provisions and contingent liabilities are assessed continually to determine \nwhether an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential \nhas become more or less probable. If it becomes more probable that such an outflow \nwill be required, a provision is recognized in the financial statements of the year in \nwhich the change of probability occurs. Similarly, where it becomes less probable \nthat such an outflow will be required, a contingent liability is disclosed in the notes \nto the financial statements.  \n80.

Voluntary c ontributions and other transfers that are supported by legally \nenforceable agreements are recognized as revenue at the time when the agreement \nbecomes binding, which is the point when the Organization is deemed to acquire control \nof the asset. However, whe n cash is received subject to specific conditions, recognition \nof revenue is deferred until those conditions have been satisfied.

A joint arrangement is an arrangement by which two or more parties have joint \ncontrol through a binding arrangement which gives those parties joint control of the \narrangement. This is a contractual arrangement w hereby the Organization and one or \nmore parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control and can be \nclassified under IPSAS 37: Joint arrangements, as either of the following:  \n (a) A joint operation whereby the parties to the arrange ment have rights to \nassets and obligations for liabilities. The Organization will account for the assets, \nliabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in \naccordance with the IPSAS standard applicable to the particular as sets, liabilities, \nrevenues and expenses;  \n (b) A joint venture whereby the parties to the arrangement have rights to the \nnet assets and/or obligations for net liabilities. The Organization will account for its \ninterest using the equity method. The equity method initially records the interest at \ncost and is adjusted thereafter for the post -acquisition changes in the Organization\u2019s \nshare of net assets.

The statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts (statement V) \npresents the difference between budget amounts, which are prepared on a modified \ncash basis, and actual income and expenditure on a comparable basis.  \n106. For IPSAS report ing purposes, approved budgets are the appropriations, \ncommitment authorities and income estimates authorized by resolutions of the \nGeneral Assembly.  \n107. The original budget for 2022 is the budget approved by the General Assembly \nfor 2022 in resolution 76/247  A to C. The final budget reflects additional \nappropriations and commitment authority in accordance with resolutions 76/246  B, \n76/271 , 77/4  and decision 76/564. Actual income and expenditure amounts include \ncommitments and actuals incurred in the period on the budget basi s.  \n108. Explanations for material differences between the original and final budget \namounts, as well as material differences between the final budget amounts and actual \nincome and expenditure on a modified cash basis, which are deemed to be those \ngreater than 5 per cent, are considered below.  \n \nBudget part  Material differences greater than 5 per cent  \n  Income :  \nGeneral income  Actual income 104.0 per cent more than the final budget  \nThe variance is attributable mainly to higher -than-budgeted income relating to \nrefunds of previous years\u2019 expenditure and additional bank interest income \nresulting from the higher interest rate environment.  \nServices to the \npublic  Actual income 42.8 per cent less than the final budget  \nThe variance is attributable mainly to a lower -than-budgeted net revenue from \nservices to visitors due to COVID -19 restrictions, the gradual resumption of \nvisitors\u2019 operations in various duty stations and the reduced guided tour \noperations in Geneva owing to t he refurbishment work being undertaken at the \nPalais des Nations under the strategic heritage plan.  \nExpenditure :  \nOverall \npolicymaking, \ndirection and \ncoordination  Actual expenditure 7.0 per cent less than the final budget  \nThe variance is attributable mai nly to the underexpenditures for the Department \nfor General Assembly and Conference Management. Meeting schedules did not \nfully return to the pre -pandemic pattern, and only 91 per cent of programmed \nmeetings were delivered. In addition, the related provisi ons under other staff \ncosts and contractual services, which allow the Department to supplement the \nbudget for core staff to meet requirements during the high workload sessions, \nwere not fully utilized. Furthermore, as the Department transitioned to a post -\nCOVID -19 environment, in the course of 2022, it remained challenging to \nrecruit staff to vacant posts, resulting in lower post expenditures.  \n \n \n  Reconciliation between actual amounts on a comparable basis and the statement of \ncash flows  \n \n109.

Basis differences capture the differences resulting from preparing the budget on \na modified cash basis. To reconcile the budgetary results to the statement of cash \nflows, the modified -cash elements, such as unliquidated commitments against the \nbudget, whic h do not represent a cash flow, must be eliminated. Similarly, IPSAS -\nspecific differences, such as payments against prior -year commitments and investing \ncash flows relating to acquisition of property, plant and equipment or intangibles are \nincluded as basi s differences to reconcile to the statement of cash flows.  \n111. Presentation differences are differences in the format and classification schemes \nin the statement of cash flows and the statement of comparison of budget and actual \namounts, which include th e latter not presenting revenue and the net changes in cash \npool balances. Other presentation differences are that the amounts included in the \nstatement of comparison of budget and actual amounts are not segregated into \noperating, investing and financing a ctivities.  \n112. Entity differences arise when the actual amounts on the budget basis omit \nprogrammes or fund groups that are part of the Organization, as reported in the \nstatement of cash flows, or vice versa. Those differences represent cash flows to or \nfrom fund groups other than the regular budget that are reported in the financial \nstatements. The financial statements include results for all the Organization\u2019s fund \ngroups.  \n113. Timing differences occur when the budget period differs from the reporting \nperiod reflected in the financial statements. There are no timing differences as the \nbudget reflects the 2022 annual budget.  \n \n  Note 6  \n  Cash and cash equivalents  \n \n(Thousands of United States dollars)  \n \n \n 31 December 2022  31 December 2021  \n   Main pool (notes 30 and 31)a 804 536  588 031  \nEuro pool (notes 30 and 31)  4 456  11 351  \nUnited Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness \nand Accidents investments (note 30)  32 043  38 251  \nOther cash and cash equivalents  10 836  8 900  \n Total  851 871 646 533  \n \n a Includes non -convertible Syrian pounds equivalent to -$0.079 million (2021: -$0.464 million).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff84e9c3-715b-4c07-aa1d-4d6ef7a206bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff84e9c3-715b-4c07-aa1d-4d6ef7a206bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "332", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c93dc7f9-db20-4fc8-8e26-d18b6873c1ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "332", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "a242826cd347140e314fa7b06a96ef149f47f304e74343ce86909c31fe2e3d17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6a4bc62-10cc-4166-93f2-d9bb4167e678", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "331", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9639b4446304324ce739edbc45c4ccc7c47270b4a74a6cc2f85229a0196baea5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2beb6bf1-da4c-4b90-80a3-cca374b00caf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "333", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "73c73b7cc9879e06bd668f08e4486385bd010827cfa294d05d812907d1fe2cdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2196014daeb2b183c6b1841a168955a90c1a57a2dddf3318fa789ac3a8ab74b0", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  Operations of the United Nations as reported in volume I  \nNotes to the financial statements  (continued)  \n \n330/396 23-11009  \n 114.

The after -service health insurance programme is funded on a pay -as-you-go \nbasis as medical benefits are accessed by retirees, with increasing cost attributabl e \nnotably to, changing demographics, improved life expectancy and increased cost of \nhealth -care services. To address the growing costs of health insurance, the \nOrganization has over the years adopted cost containment initiatives while ensuring \nthat partici pants continue to have access to appropriate insurance coverage to meet \ntheir health -care needs. Health insurance costs are controlled by the manner in which \nthe plans are structured and through ongoing reviews of plan provisions and benefits \noffered.

The salary increase rate and the demographic assumptions used for the 2021 full \nvaluation were provided by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund. The salary \nincrease assumptions for the Professional staff category were 9.27 per cent for the \nage of 19 years, grading down  to 3.97 per cent for the age of 65 years. The salaries of \nthe General Service staff category were assumed to increase by 6.84 per cent for the \nage of 19 years, grading down to 3.97 per cent at the age of 65 years. These are capped \nat 65 because this is th e mandatory age of retirement for United Nations staff.  \n143.

The most recent actuarial valuation for the Pension Fund was completed as at \n31 December 2021, and a roll -forward of the particip ation data as at 31 December \n2021 to 31 December 2022 will be used by the Pension Fund for its 2022 financial \nstatements.  \n169. The actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2021 resulted in a funded ratio of \nactuarial assets to actuarial liabilities of 117.0 per cent (2019: 107.1 per cent). The \nfunded ratio was 158.2 per cent (2019: 144.4 per cent) when the current system of \npension adjustments was not taken into account.  \n170. After assessing the actuarial sufficiency of the Pension Fund, the consulting \nactua ry concluded that there was no requirement, as at 31 December 2021, for \ndeficiency payments under article 26 of the Regulations of the Fund, given that the \nactuarial value of assets exceeded the actuarial value of all accrued liabilities under \nthe plan. In  addition, the market value of assets also exceeded the actuarial value of \nall accrued liabilities as at the valuation date. At the time of reporting, the General \nAssembly had not invoked the provision of article 26.  \n171. Should article 26 be invoked beca use of an actuarial deficiency, either during \nthe ongoing operation or owing to the termination of the Pension Fund pension plan, \ndeficiency payments required from each member organization would be based upon \nthe proportion of that member organization\u2019s co ntributions to the total contributions \npaid to the Fund during the three years preceding the valuation date. Total \ncontributions paid to the Pension Fund during the preceding three years (2019, 2020 \nand 2021) amounted to $8,505.27 million, of which 18.8 pe r cent was contributed by \nthe Organization.  \n172. During 2022, the Organization\u2019s contributions, including the staff portion, paid \nto the Pension Fund amounted to $553.6 million (2021: $530.4 million). The \nOrganization expects to contribute approximately th e same amount in 2023.  \n173. Membership in the Pension Fund may be terminated by decision of the General \nAssembly, upon the affirmative recommendation of the Pension Board. A \nproportionate share of the total assets of the Pension Fund at the date of termina tion \nshall be paid to the former member organization for the exclusive benefit of its staff \nwho were participants in the Fund at that date, pursuant to an arrangement mutually \nagreed between the organization and the Fund. The amount is determined by the \nPension Board on the basis of an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the \nPension Fund on the date of termination; no part of the assets that are in excess of the \nliabilities are included in the amount.  \n174. The Board of Auditors carries out an annual audit of the Pension Fund and \nreports to the Pension Board and to the General Assembly on the audit every year. \nThe Pension Fund publishes quarterly reports on its investments, which can be viewed \non the Fund\u2019s website ( www.unjspf.org ).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b92c4e6a-b76c-4d23-a709-c214f2436e9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b92c4e6a-b76c-4d23-a709-c214f2436e9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "354", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7c01235b-6d1f-458c-8468-93accb43b74d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "354", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "77cf4259e3e175e31cf714b874a49bf9af14bb45139f24c356d946eb971bc324", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43ba1c50-70ce-49a2-ada5-0a4c44fbf494", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "353", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "725e88cbc486677d830df04bf549e702ac9cb396bf9b80923706d683fcf0dae6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5de81d61-f114-4aab-8b37-2666dc87d3f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "355", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "c01abdd0d1937d431184c937a744bd3968f2f88930a29473e6a9f225f106db51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a07c6f6a6d62d8160afafaeed7230b08990475bce73bd1f6134601601a73ebf1", "text": "A/78/5 (Vol. I)  Operations of the United Nations as reported in volume I  \nNotes to the financial statements  (continued)  \n \n352/396 23-11009  \n   Note 19  \n  Provisions  \n \n  2022  \n(Thousands of United States dollars)  \n \n \n Credits to \nMember States  Litigation \nand claims  Restoration  Insurance claims \n(incurred but \nnot reported)  Total  \n      Provisions as at 31 December 2021  340 488  1 165  948 121 823  464 424  \nAdditional provisions made  81 292  1 088  \u2013 128 460  210 840  \nAmounts reversed  (60 259)  (1 126)  (99) \u2013 (61 484)  \nAmounts used  \u2013 (39) \u2013 (121 823)  (121 862)  \n Provisions as at 31 December 2022  361 521  1 088  849 128 460  491 918  \nCurrent  361 521  522 300 128 460  490 803  \nNon-current  \u2013 566 549 \u2013 1 115  \n Total  361 521  1 088  849 128 460  491 918  \n \n \n  2021  \n(Thousands of United States dollars)  \n \n \n Credits to \nMember States  Litigation \nand claims  Restoration  Insurance claims \n(incurred but \nnot reported)  Total  \n      Provisions as at 31 December 2020  98 494  1 160  894 99 421  199 969  \nAdditional provisions made  254 281  962 75 121 823  377 141  \nAmounts reversed  (12 287)  (397)  (21) \u2013 (12 705)  \nAmounts used  \u2013 (560)  \u2013 (99 421)  (99 981)  \n Provisions as at 31 December 2021  340 488  1 165  948 121 823  464 424  \nCurrent  340 488  1 165  326 121 823  463 802  \nNon-current  \u2013 \u2013 622 \u2013 622 \n Total  340 488  1 165  948 121 823  464 424  \n \n \n175.

The General Assembly, in its resolution 70/248  A, approved the financing of the \nstrategic heritage plan project in part through an interest -free loan from the host \ncountry. A loan contract was signed in April 2017 between the Organization and the \nFondation des immeub les pour les organisations internationales (FIPOI) (a public \nentity under the Government of Switzerland), for a maximum loan amount of \nSwF  400 million. The Organization withdraws funds available under the loan in \nseveral tranches each year. The loan is mea sured at amortized cost using the interest \nrate of a 30 -year Swiss federal government bond. As at 31 December 2022, the \nnominal loan amount withdrawn was $264.2 million (equivalent to SwF 241.1 \nmillion), and the nominal loan amount reimbursed was $5.4 mill ion (equivalent to \nSwF 5.0 million). Its corresponding fair value at amortized cost is $243.9 million.  \n181. The loan is received at below the normal market rates, and therefore treated as \na concessionary loan. Owing to a recent change to a positive intere st rate of a 30 -year \nSwiss federal bond as at 31 December 2022, the statement of financial performance \nincludes notional finance income of $15.8 million (2021: $1.1 million finance cost \nfrom a negative interest rate).  \n \n  Note 23  \n  Controlled multi -partner trust funds  \n \n182. Multi -partner trust funds are pooled resources from multiple financial partners \nthat are allocated to multiple implementing entities to support specific national, \nregional or global development priorities. They are administered by the UND P \nMulti -Partner Trust Fund Office.  \n \n  Multi -partner trust funds where the Organization has control and is the principal  \n \n183. Common humanitarian funds have been established as partnerships between the \nUnited Nations agencies for humanitarian activities in a number of countries. The \nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs serves as the technical unit for \nthe funds and is responsible for managing the allocation process. The Organization \ntherefore controls the funds and is the principal in those  multi -partner trust funds.  \n184. The Peacebuilding Fund has financed numerous projects in multiple countries \nby delivering fast and flexible funding for peacebuilding initiatives in post -conflict \ncountries. Given that the Fund is controlled and managed by  the Peacebuilding \nSupport Office, the Organization is the principal in the Fund.  \n185. Following the adoption of General Assembly resolution 71/1 , entitled \u201cNew \nYork Declar ation for Refugees and Migrants\u201d, the Organization launched in 2017 the \nUnited Nations multi -partner trust fund to support the Global Compact for Safe, \nOrderly and Regular Migration. The Advisory Committee of the fund is chaired by \nthe Special Representati ve of the Secretary -General for International Migration. The \nCompact for Migration multi -partner trust fund closed effective June 2022 following \nthe final distribution of fund balance.  \n186. The United Nations Haiti cholera response multi -partner trust fund  was \nlaunched in 2016. The fund provides a rapid, flexible and accountable platform to \nsupport a coordinated response from the United Nations system and partners. The \nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary -General for Haiti and the Director of the Sustainable \nDeve lopment Unit of the Executive Office of the Secretary -General act as the \nCo-Chairs of the Advisory Committee of the fund.

There are also fully insured health insurance plans. At Headquarters, there is the \nhealth insurance plan of New York, which has been closed to new subscribers. In \nVienna, staff and retirees are eligible to enrol  in the Austrian national health insurance \nprogramme and the plans administered by the United Nations Industrial Development \nOrganization (full medical insurance plan and supplementary medical insurance \nplan).

\n217. The Organization has exposure to the following financial risks:  \n (a) Credit risk;  \n (b) Liquidity risk;  \n (c) Market risk.  \n218. The present note and note 31 (Financial instruments: cash pools) present \ninformation on the Organization\u2019s exposure to those risks, the objectives, policies and \nprocesses for measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital . \n \n  Risk management framework  \n \n219. The Organization\u2019s risk management practices are in accordance with its Financial \nRegulations and Rules and  Investment Management Guidelines. The Organization \ndefines the capital that it manages as the aggregate of its net assets, which comprises \naccumulated fund balances and reserves. Its objectives are to safeguard its ability to \ncontinue as a going concer n and to fund its asset base. The Organization manages its \ncapital in the light of global economic conditions, the risk characteristics of the \nunderlying assets and its current and future working capital requirements.  \n  Financial risk management: credit  risk  \n \n220. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty to a financial \ninstrument failing to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises from cash and \ncash equivalents, investments, deposits and forward currency contra cts with financial \ninstitutions, as well as credit exposure to outstanding receivables. The carrying value \nof financial assets is the maximum exposure to credit risk.  \n221. The investment management function is centralized at the United Nations \nTreasury. Ot her areas are not permitted, in normal circumstances, to engage in investing. \nAn area may receive exceptional approval when conditions warrant investing locally \nunder specified parameters that comply with the Investment Management Guidelines", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9309b4ff-3fd8-4960-8bc7-ec306c5a7464": {"__data__": {"id_": "9309b4ff-3fd8-4960-8bc7-ec306c5a7464", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "377", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5198b189-1277-4414-862c-72272f23c8bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "377", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "cca08b48597615bcf5800fd80ebe72ae68445027dab492af11a722b913975f21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a01a016-1b3d-4dc2-ba5d-56389a327ffa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "376", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "483d483b0c8303424384d4e46c2b0484e6e793af51738d4bf416d673d290dc8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "012c8c33-25eb-4f78-9059-33471037dafd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "378", "file_name": "A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/A:78:5 (Vol.I)2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7365499, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-01", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "549cedaa1313403bedb2dfb526a45db211608dc79499f3468876a7de1659521a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6ecaf7b7279d5ec289cf6011de1cb3a4f55961634959bf44ce9a2e57864ca297", "text": "Operations of the United Nations as reported in volume I  \nNotes to the financial statements  (continued)  A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n23-11009  375/396 \n   Credit risk : contributions receivable and other receivables  \n \n222.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Organization might not have adequate funds to \nmeet its obligations as they fall due. The Organization\u2019s approach to managing \nliquidity is to ensure that it will always hav e sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities \nwhen due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable \nlosses or risking damage to the Organization\u2019s reputation.  \n231. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations re quire that expenses \nbe incurred after the receipt of funds from donors, thereby considerably reducing the \nliquidity risk with regard to contributions, which are a largely stable annual cash flow. \nExceptions to incurring expenses before the receipt of funds  are permitted only if \nspecified risk management criteria are adhered to with regard to amounts receivable.  \n232. The Organization performs cash flow forecasting and monitors rolling forecasts \nof liquidity requirements to ensure that there is sufficient ca sh to meet operational \nneeds. Investments are made with due consideration to the cash requirements for \noperating purposes based on cash flow forecasting. The Organization maintains a \nlarge portion of its investments in cash equivalents and short -term inves tments \nsufficient to cover its commitments as and when they fall due.  \n233. The periodic cash shortage in the regular budget persisted and the regular budget \nfund had to borrow from the Working Capital Fund during 2022. The full balance of \nliquidity reserv e of the Working Capital Fund of $149.9 million was borrowed in \nSeptember 2022. The loan was repaid to the Working Capital Fund on 20 December \n2022. As at 31 December 2022, there were no borrowings from the Working Capital \nFund and the Special Account (202 1: $149.9 million and $0 million, respectively). \nDuring 2022 the overall liquidity situation of the regular budget improved compared \nwith 2021.  \n234.

The United Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and \nAccidents is exposed to low liquidity risk because there are only limited requirements \nto withdraw funds at short notice and it maintains sufficient cash and marketable \nsecurities, such as the exchange -traded f und, to meet commitments as and when they \nfall due. As at the reporting date, the Society had invested primarily in securities with \nshort to medium -term maturity, with the maximum being fewer than 18 years (2021: \nfewer than 19 years). The Society\u2019s liquidi ty risk is therefore considered to be low.  \n \n  Liquidity risk: financial liabilities  \n \n236. The exposure to liquidity risk is based on the notion that the entity may \nencounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities. \nThis  is highly unlikely owing to the cash and cash equivalents, receivables and \ninvestments available to the entity and internal policies and procedures put in place \nto ensure that there are appropriate resources to meet its financial obligations. As at \nthe re porting date, the Organization had pledged no collateral for any liabilities or \ncontingent liabilities (2021: none), and during the year no accounts payable or other \nliabilities were forgiven by third parties.

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange \nrates, interest rates and prices of investment securities, will affect the Organization\u2019s \nrevenue or the value of its financial as sets and liabilities. The objective of market risk \nmanagement is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable \nparameters while optimizing the Organization\u2019s fiscal position.  \n \n  Market risk: interest rate risk  \n \n238. Interest rate risk is t he risk of variability in financial instruments\u2019 fair values or \nfuture cash flows due to a change in interest rates. In general, as an interest rate rises, \nthe price of a fixed -rate security falls, and vice versa. Interest rate risk is commonly \nmeasured by  the fixed -rate security\u2019s duration, with duration being a number \nexpressed in years. The longer the duration, the greater the interest rate risk. The main \nexposure to interest rate risks relates to the cash pools and is considered in note 31 \n(Financial in struments: cash pools). The average duration of the investments of the \nUnited Nations Staff Mutual Insurance Society against Sickness and Accidents was \n2.63 years (2021: 3.58 years), which, within the investment objectives of the Society, \nis considered to be an indicator of low interest rate risk.  \n \n  Market risk: currency risk  \n \n239. Currency risk refers to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a \nfinancial instrument will fluctuate owing to changes in foreign exchange rates. The \nOrganization has transactions, assets and liabilities in currencies other than in its \nfunctio nal currency and is exposed to currency risk arising from fluctuations in \nexchange rates. Management policies and the Investment Management Guidelines \nrequire the Organization to manage its currency risk exposure.  \n240. The Organization\u2019s financial assets and liabilities are denominated primarily in \nUnited States dollars. Non -United States dollar financial assets relate primarily to \ninvestments in addition to cash and cash equivalents and receivables held to support \nlocal operating activities where transact ions are made in local currencies. The \nOrganization maintains a minimum level of assets in local currencies and, whenever \npossible, maintains bank accounts in United States dollars.

In 2022, the Organization entered into United States dollar to Swiss franc and \neuro forward contracts to hedge against currency risk in relation to the operations of \nvarious United Nations offices in Geneva, Vienna and The Hague being exposed to \nrisks aris ing primarily from fluctuations in payments for staff costs in Swiss francs \nand euros. Net realized foreign exchange losses from those contracts amounted to \n$17.5 million for the year (2021: $9.5 million loss). The losses were recorded against \nstaff and no n-staff costs, resulting in an increase in employee benefits and non -staff \nrelated expenses. There were 24 (2021: 24) forward contracts outstanding as at \n31 December 2022 with a notional amount of SwF 363.8 million and \u20ac109.0 million \nwith an unrealized gai n of $11.8 million, maturing in 2023.  \n \n  Other market price risk  \n \n244. The Organization is not exposed to other significant market price risk, as it has \nlimited exposure to price -related risk with respect to expected purchases of certain \ncommodities used in normal operations. Therefore, a change in those prices can alter \ncash flows only by an immaterial amount.  \n \n  Accounting classifications and fair value  \n \n245. The carrying value of fair value through surplus or deficit investments is fair \nvalue. For cash  and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, carrying \nvalue is a fair approximation of fair value, except for non -current voluntary \ncontributions receivable, which are reported at amortized cost calculated using the \neffective interest method as  at 31 December 2022.  \n \n  Fair value hierarchy  \n \n246. The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by the fair \nvalue hierarchy levels. The levels are defined as:  \n (a) Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identi cal assets \nor liabilities;  \n (b) Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are \nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., \nderived from prices);  \n (c) Level 3: inputs for the ass et or liability that are not based on observable \nmarket data (i.e., unobservable inputs).  \n247. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on \nquoted market prices at the reporting date and is determined by the independent \ncustodian based on valuation of securities sourced from third parties. A market is \nregarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an \nexchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and \nthose prices  represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm\u2019s \nlength basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the cash pools \nis the current bid price.  \n248. The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is \ndetermined by using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market \ndata. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of an instrument are \nobservable, the instrument is included in level 2.  \n249. There  were no level 3 financial assets or any liabilities carried at fair value or \nany transfers of financial assets between fair value hierarchy classifications.

The United Nations Treasury actively monitors credit ratings and, because the \nOrganization has invested only in securities with high credit ratings, management \ndoes not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, except for impaired \ninvestments.  \n \n  Financial risk management: liquidity risk  \n \n260. The cash pools are exposed to liquidity risk associated w ith the requirement of \nparticipants to make withdrawals on short notice. They maintain sufficient cash and \nmarketable securities to meet participants\u2019 commitments as and when they fall due. A \nmajor portion of cash and cash equivalents and investments are a vailable within a \nday\u2019s notice to support operational requirements. The cash pool liquidity risk is \ntherefore considered to be low.  \n \n  Financial risk management: interest rate risk  \n \n261. The cash pools comprise the Organization\u2019s main exposure to interest  rate risk \nwith fixed -rate cash and cash equivalents and investments being interest -bearing \nfinancial instruments. As at the reporting date, the cash pools had invested primarily \nin securities with shorter terms to maturity, with the maximum being fewer th an five \nyears (2021: fewer than three years) in the main pool and three years in the euro pool \n(2021: four years). The average duration of investments of the main pool on \n31 December 2022 was 0.77 years (2021: 0.49 years). In addition, the average \nduration  of investments of the euro pool on 31 December 2022 was 0.28 years (2021: \n0.26 years). These are considered to be indicators of low risk.  \n \n  Cash pool interest rate risk sensitivity analysis  \n \n262. The analysis shows how the fair value of the cash pools a s at the reporting date \nwould increase or decrease should the overall yield curve shift in response to changes \nin interest rates.

of the United Nations as reported in volume I  \nNotes to the financial statements  (continued)  A/78/5 (Vol. I)  \n \n393/396 23-11009  \n   The United Nations Foundation, Inc.  \n \n272. The United Nations Foundation, Inc., a not -for-profit corporation organized \nunder the laws of the State of New York of the United States of America, entered into \nan agreement with the United Nations in 1998 to assist and support the United Nations \nin achie ving the goals and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. The revised \nand restated relationship agreement signed in 2014 reaffirmed the nature of the \nrelationship, the terms of the partnership, the independent status of the parties and the \ncondit ions for use of the name \u201cUnited Nations\u201d; the relationship agreement also sets \nout the role, composition and functions of the joint coordination committee, which \nserves as the principal forum for strong communication and coordination on strategies \nto supp ort the policies, aims, activities and causes of the United Nations. The \ncommittee is co -chaired by the United Nations and the United Nations Foundation \nand meets twice a year. A summary of the relationship agreement can be found via \nthe following link: https://unfoundation.org/who -we-are/our -financials/un -foundation -\nun-relationship . During 2022, the Foundation made total contri butions of $27.3 million \nto UNFIP (2021: $11.6 million). Audited financial statements of the Foundation can \nbe found on its website ( www.unfoundation.org ) \n \n  Receivables due from  peacekeeping operations  \n \n273. The Organization has receivables in the amount of $37.4 million (2021: \n$37.4  million) and $10.0 million (2021: $10.0 million) due from the United Nations \nOperation in the Congo and the United Nations Emergency Force, respect ively. These \nmissions were operational before the current financing mechanism for peacekeeping \noperations was established, and closed on 30 June 1964 and 30 June 1967, \nrespectively. The repayment by these United Nations peacekeeping operations is \ndependent  upon collections of outstanding contributions from Member States. Given \nthe age of these contributions, a full provision for doubtful debts has been recorded.  \n \n  Note 33  \n  Leases and commitments  \n \n  Finance leases  \n \n274. The Organization leases certain com munications and information technology \nequipment under commercial finance leases and holds some donated right -to-use real \nestate arrangements that meet the criteria of finance leases. As at year end, \ncommercial finance leased assets had been fully deprecia ted. The carrying value of \ndonated right -to-use arrangements meeting the finance lease recognition criteria \ntotalled $51.1 million (2021: $55.6 million). The main portion of the donated right -\nto-use amount relates to the $50.1 million (2021: $54.4 million)  interest in the Vienna \nInternational Centre, with the remaining amount relating to the Asian and Pacific \nCentre for Transfer of Technology of ESCAP and the ESCAP Subregional Office for \nSouth and South -West Asia, both located in New Delhi, and the Departme nt of Global \nCommunications/United Nations Information Centre offices in Brazzaville and \nOuagadougou.

Sadly, these numbers are expected to rise as the attacks are ongoing and many remain unaccounted for.\n\nIn addition, over 100, possibly more, Israelis \u2014 civilians and military \u2014 have been reported captured by armed groups, including women, children and the elderly.  Some are being held hostage inside Israel and many others have been taken inside the Gaza Strip.  Meanwhile, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have launched thousands of indiscriminate rockets that have reached central Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\nI recognize the legitimate grievances of the Palestinian people.  But, nothing can justify these acts of terror and the killing, maiming and abduction of civilians.  I reiterate my call to immediately cease these attacks and release all hostages.\n\nIn the face of these unprecedented attacks, Israeli air strikes have pounded Gaza.  I am deeply alarmed by reports of over 500 Palestinians \u2014 including women and children \u2014 killed in Gaza and over 3,000 injured.  Unfortunately, these numbers are rising by the minute as Israeli operations continue. While I recognize Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns, I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance with international humanitarian law.\u2003\n\nCivilians must be respected and protected at all times.  Civilian infrastructure must never be a target.  We already have reports of Israeli missiles striking health facilities inside Gaza, as well as multi-storied residential towers and a mosque. Two UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East] schools sheltering displaced families in Gaza were also hit.  Some 137,000 people are currently sheltering in UNRWA facilities, with the number increasing as heavy shelling and airstrikes continue.\n\nI am deeply distressed by today\u2019s announcement that Israel will initiate a complete siege of the Gaza Strip, nothing allowed in \u2014 no electricity, food or fuel.  The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially.\n\nMedical equipment, food, fuel and other humanitarian supplies are desperately needed, along with access for humanitarian personnel.  Relief and entry of essential supplies into Gaza must be facilitated and the UN will continue efforts to provide aid to respond to these needs.\n\nI urge all sides and the relevant parties to allow United Nations access to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians trapped and helpless in the Gaza Strip.  I appeal to the international community to mobilize immediate humanitarian support for this effort.\n\nThe UN Special Coordinator and I are engaging with leaders in the region to express our concern, our outrage and to advance efforts to avoid any spillover to the wider Middle East.\n\nEven in these worst of times \u2014 and perhaps especially in the most trying moments \u2014 it is vital to look to the long-term horizon and avoid irreversible action that would embolden extremists and doom any prospects for lasting peace.\n\nThis most recent violence does not come in a vacuum.  The reality is that it grows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year long occupation and no political end in sight. It\u2019s time to end this vicious circle of bloodshed, hatred and polarization.  Israel must see its legitimate needs for security materialized and Palestinians must see a clear perspective for the establishment of their own State realized.\n\nOnly a negotiated peace that fulfils the legitimate national aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis, together with their security alike \u2014 the long-held vision of a two-State solution, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements \u2014 can bring long-term stability to the people of this land and the wider Middle East region.

"SG/SM/22003\n24 OCTOBER 2023\n\u2018Even War Has Rules\u2019, Secretary-General Tells Security Council, Demanding All Parties in Middle East Uphold International Humanitarian Law, Unrestricted Aid for Gaza\nFollowing are UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 remarks to the Security Council open debate on the Middle East, in New York today:\n\nThe situation in the Middle East is growing more dire by the hour.  The war in Gaza is raging and risks spiralling throughout the region.  Divisions are splintering societies.  Tensions threaten to boil over.\n\nAt a crucial moment like this, it is vital to be clear on principles \u2014 starting with the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians.  I have condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel.\n\nNothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians \u2014 or the launching of rockets against civilian targets. All hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions.  I respectfully note the presence among us of members of their families.\n\nIt is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.  The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished.  Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.\n\nBut, the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.  And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\n\nEven war has rules.  We must demand that all parties uphold and respect their obligations under international humanitarian law; take constant care in the conduct of military operations to spare civilians; and respect and protect hospitals and respect the inviolability of UN facilities which today are sheltering more than 600,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, the level of civilian casualties, and the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming.\n\nI mourn and honour the dozens of UN colleagues working for UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East] \u2014 sadly, at least 35 and counting \u2014 killed in the bombardment of Gaza over the last two weeks.  I owe to their families my condemnation of these and many other similar killings.\n\nThe protection of civilians is paramount in any armed conflict.  Protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields.  Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than 1 million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.\n\nI am deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza.  Let me be clear:  No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law.\n\nThankfully, some humanitarian relief is finally getting into Gaza.  But it is a drop of aid in an ocean of need.  In addition, our UN fuel supplies in Gaza will run out in a matter of days.  That would be another disaster.  Without fuel, aid cannot be delivered, hospitals will not have power, and drinking water cannot be purified or even pumped.\n\nThe people of Gaza need continuous aid delivery at a level that corresponds to the enormous needs.  That aid must be delivered without restrictions.  I salute our UN colleagues and humanitarian partners in Gaza working under hazardous conditions and risking their lives to provide aid to those in need.  They are an inspiration.\n\nTo ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer, and facilitate the release of hostages, I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\n\nEven in this moment of grave and immediate danger, we cannot lose sight of the only realistic foundation for a true peace and stability:  a two-State solution.  Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized, and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for an independent State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements.\n\nFinally, we must be clear on the principle of upholding human dignity.  Polarization and dehumanization are being fuelled by a tsunami of disinformation.  We must stand up to the forces of antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and all forms of hate.\n\nToday is United Nations Day, marking 78 years since the UN Charter entered into force.  That Charter reflects our shared commitment to advance peace, sustainable development and human rights.  On this UN Day, at this critical hour, I appeal to all to pull back from the brink before the violence claims even more lives and spreads even farther.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f814762b-7818-4a8b-9ddf-d795da531af1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f814762b-7818-4a8b-9ddf-d795da531af1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/SG_SM_22020_press_release.txt", "file_name": "SG_SM_22020_press_release.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1968, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd269aaa-ffab-400b-9869-a8f844ab6d6c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/SG_SM_22020_press_release.txt", "file_name": "SG_SM_22020_press_release.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1968, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "9cac2876529905aea3d6a22f2f4a104d9176daf739d2cf6080c9d072cc870cc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81d06f53-04b8-49e4-96f1-86a78abd0396", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/SG_SM_22003_press_release.txt", "file_name": "SG_SM_22003_press_release.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4956, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "274818b790f9d001ec7764332887bb1678390a54ed864f7799c22f949df75400", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ab6fcb3-93ac-48b9-9fd9-ce1c0fa04180", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "UN_STaff_Rues_ST_SGB_2017_1-EN.pdf", "file_path": "data/UN_STaff_Rues_ST_SGB_2017_1-EN.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1515658, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "18690ea761452dca2bcef0debb2a4973021fd61abb6c72056a95a375488698b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "664242a489dcb9b4e0bd37ea1f03cd83d8fa3021acf86c0fcdefebb08b117454", "text": "SG/SM/22020\n3 NOVEMBER 2023\nCalling Situation in Gaza Horrific, Secretary-General Renews Appeal for Humanitarian Ceasefire\nThe following statement by UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres was issued today:\n\nI am horrified by the reported attack in Gaza on an ambulance convoy outside Al Shifa hospital.  The images of bodies strewn on the street outside the hospital are harrowing.\n\nI do not forget the terror attacks committed in Israel by Hamas and the killing, maiming and abductions, including of women and children. All hostages held in Gaza must be released immediately and unconditionally.\n\nNow, for nearly one month, civilians in Gaza, including children and women, have been besieged, denied aid, killed and bombed out of their homes.  This must stop.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is horrific.  Not nearly enough food, water and medicine are coming in to meet people\u2019s needs.  Fuel to power hospitals and water plants is running out.  United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) shelters are at nearly four times their full capacity and are being hit in bombardments.  Morgues are overflowing.  Shops are empty.  The sanitation situation is abysmal.  We are seeing an increase in diseases and respiratory illnesses, especially among children.  An entire population is traumatized.  Nowhere is safe.\n\nI renew my earlier appeals for a humanitarian ceasefire.  International humanitarian law must be respected. Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including humanitarian and medical workers and assets must be protected. Civilians must also not be used as human shields.\n\nEssential supplies and services and unimpeded humanitarian access must be safely allowed into and across Gaza at a scale commensurate with this dramatic situation.\n\nAll those with influence must exert it to ensure respect for the rules of war, end the suffering and avoid a spillover of the conflict that could engulf the whole region.",

In every case, the poorest \nand most vulnerable people and communities are \nhit hardest. \nMeanwhile, human rights are under assault, worsened \nby widening economic and social gaps and the lingering \neffects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nWomen and young people continue to be shut out of \neconomic, civic and social spaces, denying entire \nsocieties their contributions and ideas.  Shrinking civic \nspace, the rapid spread of mis- and disinformation and \nrising hate speech and misogyny are pushing people apart at a time when we need unity and solidarity more than ever.\nWe face the highest levels of geopolitical mistrust and \ncompetition in decades. Sharp divisions are growing \nwithin countries and across the global community. \nCountries and entire regions are turning their backs on \none another, leaving the urgent and essential business \nof jointly shaping a better future to wither on the vine. \nAt the same time, humanity continues to grapple with balancing the great promise of technological \ninnovations such as artificial intelligence and social \nmedia with the need to address clear threats to people\u2019s \nrights to safety and privacy.\n1  I n line with the regular budget of the United Nations Secretariat, the \nreporting period is from 1\u00a0January to 31 December 2022.

Thanks to the generosity of our donors, we mobilized a record \n$30 billion in humanitarian aid.\nWe responded to regional crises across the Sahel and \nthe Horn of Africa, which face a deadly combination \nof drought, poverty, insecurity and the looming risk of famine. We reached 17 million people in the Horn of \nAfrica with humanitarian assistance in 2022, and some \n20 million people across the Sahel. \nIn Afghanistan, the United Nations and our partners \nreached more than 26 million people in 2022 with \nhumanitarian assistance and protection, including in \npreviously inaccessible locations, while pushing back \nagainst the unacceptable curtailment of women\u2019s and \ngirls\u2019 rights, in particular their access to education and \nlivelihoods.\nPeace is the beating heart of the United Nations.

The Peacebuilding Fund \ncommitted $231 million to supporting peacebuilding \nefforts across 37 countries, with more than a third \nof those funds dedicated to supporting women and \nyoung people. \nIn Ukraine, the United Nations stayed and delivered, \nsupporting close to 16 million people through our \nhumanitarian response plan. \nTo mitigate global food insecurity and its humanitarian \nimpact, we proposed the Initiative on the Safe \nTransportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian \nPorts (Black Sea Initiative) to T\u00fcrkiye, the Russian \nFederation and Ukraine. As at mid-June 2023, the \nInitiative had enabled the export of over 32 million tons \nof grain and other foodstuffs, with over half of food \nexports going to developing countries. Meanwhile, \nthe United Nations continued its efforts under the \nMemorandum of Understanding between the Russian \nFederation and the Secretariat of the United Nations to \nfacilitate the unimpeded access to the global markets \nof  Russian food products and fertilizers, which are not \nsubject to sanctions. We will continue to press for a just and sustainable peace, in line with the Charter of the United Nations. \nWe are collaborating with regional organizations, \nincluding the African Union, to build the foundations of peace in countries that have seen too little of it. \nIn 2022, we continued to rally countries around the \nurgent need to end the threat from weapons of mass \ndestruction through important meetings on the Treaty \non the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the Review \nConference of the States Parties to the Convention on \nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production and \nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin \nWeapons and on Their Destruction. The first ever United Nations Global Congress of \nVictims of Terrorism gave a voice to people who have \na critical role to play in efforts to fight this scourge \naround the world. \nOur country teams worked tirelessly throughout the \npast year to help Governments build stronger and \nmore equal economies, societies and systems that \ncan support their people. \nAnd yet, halfway to 2030, progress on the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals has stalled and, in some cases, \neven gone into reverse. \nDeveloping countries are victims of a dysfunctional \nand unfair global financial system that denies them \nthe financing and debt relief that they need to invest \nin renewable energy, universal social protection, \nquality education, decent job creation, universal health \ncoverage, sustainable food systems, infrastructure and \nthe digital transformation. \nTo address the global financing crisis, we launched a \nSustainable Development Goal stimulus proposal to accelerate achievement of the Goals, with the aim of mobilizing $500 billion in new investments. Through \nthe stimulus proposal, we target three actions on which \nthe current international financial architecture can \ndeliver results: (a) addressing costly debt and growing \ndebt distress; (b) massively boosting affordable long-\nterm financing; and (c) expanding contingency funds for countries in need.\nThe Transforming Education Summit placed \neducation back on the global agenda and resulted in \ncommitments to revamp education systems for the \nmodern world, recover ground lost in education during \nthe pandemic and unlock the potential of technology for girls\u2019 education.Over  \n36,000\nUnited Nations \nSecretariat staff \ndelivering results \nacross eight priority areas\n15Sustainable development\nUnited Nations country teams led by resident \ncoordinators work in 162  countries and territories \nto help to implement the 2030 Agenda.\nPeace and security\nDeployed 53 peacekeeping operations, special \npolitical missions, and support offices to prevent conflict and support peacebuilding. \nHumanitarian assistance\nHelped to mobilize a record $30B  to assist 216M  \npeople across 69 countries and territories.\nDrugs, crime and terrorism\nAssisted 29 Member States in drafting or revising \nfirearms legislation and supported 60 countries in \ncountering and preventing cybercrime.

can continue to engage.\nThe nature of increasingly \ncommon global shocks means that countries are not individually responsible.\nCountries should make use \nof all existing mechanisms to address the consequences of war and its global impacts.\nAll stakeholders from all \nsectors should align to help the most vulnerable populations.

Policymakers must target vulnerable groups around the poverty line, and support not only lives but livelihoods.\nTwo broad approaches are \nrequired: mitigating shock impacts and increasing the capacity of people and countries to cope.\nIn developing countries, there \nis no answer to the cost-of-living crisis without an answer to the finance crisis.\nThe global debt architecture is \nnot ready to face the current crisis.KEY MESSAGES   \non the energy crisis\nUndertaking the right energy policies should not be a luxury available only to those that can afford them. \nGlobal solidarity is needed to \navoid a scramble for fuel.\nThe most vulnerable need \ntargeted support. \nAn integrated, people-centred \npolicy approach, which includes food-related policies, is necessary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c878c5bd-f9f7-4175-b0e9-f2fe2bb9eb7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c878c5bd-f9f7-4175-b0e9-f2fe2bb9eb7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3f4d907-3ad1-4f02-a84d-851a98bb20ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "16902117e495d5567fae21126600c036b38eb4fd9d6bb8edabb162cd3b3eb84b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9013ff6-4ce1-4d60-ab0b-8667c60115b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "55a16c7b4fc4ff9319d7fa1174c04f53f56a3ce1a97e921475593f41c4549ed6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09293c22-5932-498d-ae1a-ff863c75b6ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "79ab96e1087da91930e3c1c7e96f442f1d1ca692deb3b32897ba9ccf14620419", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f7944dd95a9df5bebe9158292583acaa02bff3e17b4bfef37cb3a6648711a314", "text": "INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTIONDETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023 \u200329 28\u2003DETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023In focus: Black Sea Initiative and \nMemorandum of Understanding\nDETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023 \u200329 28INTRODUCTION\nThe Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian Ports (Black Sea Initiative) was \nsigned by T\u00fcrkiye, the Russian Federation and Ukraine and witnessed by the United Nations on 22 July 2022.

Across the globe, \nour resident coordinators lead joined-up efforts \nby the United Nations family to provide support to \nGovernments aimed at achieving global goals. Our \nguiding agendas include the Paris Agreement, the \nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, \nthe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \n2015\u20132030, the Beijing Declaration and Platform \nfor Action, the Copenhagen Declaration on Social \nDevelopment and the Programme of Action of the \nWorld Summit for Social Development, the Addis \nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International \nConference on Financing for Development, the New \nUrban Agenda, the Doha Programme of Action for the \nLeast Developed Countries, the Vienna Programme \nof Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for \nthe Decade 2014\u20132024 and the SIDS Accelerated \nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway. KEY OUTCOMES\nIMPLEMENTING THE 2030 AGENDA\nDespite global setbacks, we persevered and supported \nMember States in advancing the 2030 Agenda. \nIn March 2022, we established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to \ncoordinate the world\u2019s response to rising food and \nenergy prices, shrinking budgets, surging food insecurity and growing unrest. Between April and August 2022, the Group shared policy briefs with \ndecision makers across the globe on how to safeguard \nlives and livelihoods. \nAt the high-level political forum on sustainable development held in July 2022, Member States \nreaffirmed their commitment to the 2030 Agenda and \nthe Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing from five \nregional forums and 44 voluntary national reviews, the \nhigh-level political forum served to establish common \nroad maps to get implementation of the 2030 Agenda \nback on track. \nThe Transforming Education Summit, held in September \n2022, placed education back on the global agenda. \nAs a result, commitments were secured from 133 \ncountries to revamp education systems for the modern \nworld, recover ground lost in education during the \npandemic and unlock the potential of technology for girls\u2019 education.\nBuilding on the United Nations Food Systems Summit \nheld in 2021, we also created the new United Nations \nFood Systems Coordination Hub. The Hub brings together knowledge and expertise from across the United Nations family to support countries in \ntransforming agriculture for the twenty-first century. \n36\u201cResident coordinators help \ncountries to accelerate \nthe implementation of the \nSDGs, enabling United Nations teams to work together better, with \nGovernments and partners, \nfor transformative policy shifts and financing for \ndevelopment.\u201d\nOscar Fernandez-Taranco, Assistant-Secretary-\nGeneral for Development Coordination\u201cWe need to remain \nsteadfast in championing \nthe 2030 Agenda as the \nblueprint for current crisis response and recovery and ensure sustainable \ndevelopment for all.\u201d \nLi Junhua, Under-Secretary-General for Economic \nand Social Affairs", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da180f81-c5b6-4d32-96a3-f668565c8388": {"__data__": {"id_": "da180f81-c5b6-4d32-96a3-f668565c8388", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf7de2d3-b5be-4475-9015-e3e69d43a8c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "d2b84999f7a6e0afd6b13bd6626b65852c3bfb91f80a8d58c5e12ff7d5e6daaf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "39330319-e0e5-4746-95c8-8f5b1109f6f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "b493d252ec6e965dbb24dc0a4cc7376c4013218b3c5ca3e72407d17a906e9831", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "931d09ce-2337-43b2-b4e1-16ba87344f8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ca73028bab80a1b43dd772546598a546721bd6e06141fe3a4c78c7c17b80e5fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c359c3e51819e089926e89b62103391c2dbcf69aa794b83de1109a052595deaf", "text": "DETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023 \u200339 38\u2003DETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023\nPROMOTION OF SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT \nDETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023 \u200339\nA \u201cSing For Hope\u201d SDG piano is part of an \nexhibition at United Nations Headquarters.

Over the course of that \nyear, more than 2,000 satellites were \nregistered, breaking the annual record \nfor the third time in a row. Overall, 88 \nper cent of satellites launched into \nspace are registered with the United \nNations. These satellites provide \nservices and data that can drive \nsustainable development.

The Financing for Sustainable \nDevelopment Report 2022 highlighted critical barriers \nthat limit the ability of developing countries to manage \nthe fallout from the war in Ukraine and to invest in \npandemic recovery, climate action and the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. In following the recommendations \nset out in the report, we supported a high-level retreat \non the global financial architecture. In July 2022, that \nretreat helped to launch the Bridgetown Initiative, paved \nthe way for the Sustainable Development Goal stimulus \nproposal and led to recommendations for reform. \nDuring the 2023 session of the Economic and Social \nCouncil forum on financing for development follow-up, \ncountries also committed themselves to expanding \nsocial protection and improving access to concessional \nfinancing and debt relief for vulnerable countries. At \nthe same time, the Organization launched a financing \nfacility to support countries in formulating new national \nfinancing strategies for achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. With our capacity development \ninitiative for infrastructure management, for example, \nthe United Nations helped more than 3,500 government \nofficials maximize the value of such investments. \nWe also took action to boost private investment in \nsustainable development. The Global Investors for \nSustainable Development Alliance helped to scale \nup long-term private financing for sustainable \ninfrastructure and offered policy recommendations \nfor mobilizing more funds.

Through the stimulus \nproposal, the Secretary-General targets three actions on which \nthe current international financial architecture can deliver \nresults: (a)  addressing costly debt and growing debt distress; \n(b) massively boosting affordable long-term financing; and (c) expanding contingency funds for countries in need.\nThe Organization helped Member States to pool their \ndevelopment assistance for greater impact on the \nSustainable Development Goals. In 2022, the Joint \nSustainable Development Goals Fund channelled over \n$260 million to 31 United Nations organizations to \nhelp 119 Member States to respond to the cost-of-\nliving crisis, extend social benefits for over 175 million \npeople and leverage over $2.3 billion in additional \nfinancing. The Fund also opened a new \u201cdevelopment \nemergency\u201d window to help to address the food, energy \nand finance crises.\nWe kept up our commitment to support development \neven in the most complex and fragile settings. One \nquarter of the world\u2019s population lives in conflict-\naffected countries. The Sustainable Development \nGoals cannot be achieved without a focus on these \nsettings.

For the first time, the Commission on the Status \nof Women acknowledged the links between climate \nchange and gender equality. The Commission called on \nGovernments, the United Nations, financial institutions \nand multi-stakeholder platforms to step up action by \nbuilding resilience, mitigating risks and promoting \nsustainable recovery. \nThe 2022 annual gender snapshot report revealed \nthe reality of global gender inequality: more than a \nquarter of countries are \u201cfar or very far\u201d off track for \nachieving their 2030 gender targets. Less than 50 per \ncent of the data needed to monitor gender equality \n(Sustainable Development Goal 5) is available. At \nthe current pace, it would take 286 years to remove \ndiscriminatory laws and close prevailing gaps in legal \nprotections for women and girls. Equal representation \nin workplace leadership will take 140 years. National parliaments will not see gender parity for 40 years.\nThrough our partnership with the European Union, \nthe Spotlight Initiative allocated nearly $100 million \nin 2022 to action against gender-based violence. We \nstrengthened protection systems, invested in social \nservices and delivered programming in more than 30 countries.

The special representatives \nand envoys of the Secretary-General worked with \nconflict parties to achieve ceasefires and political \nsettlements. In Yemen, a United Nations-brokered \ntruce delivered tangible benefits to the Yemeni people \nand enabled the parties to discuss the de-escalation \nof hostilities. In Libya, we supported inclusive \nconsultations with stakeholders on overcoming the \nprotracted political impasse and holding national elections. In Lebanon, our peacekeeping mission \nsupported stability, including through support to a \nregular tripartite forum. In Abyei, we assisted efforts to improve intercommunal relations. In Colombia, the \nUnited Nations mission expanded its peacebuilding \nsupport, as requested by the new Government, and \naccompanied the resumed peace talks between the Government and the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional \n(National Liberation Army). In the Central African \nRepublic, we supported the government-led peace \nprocess that contributed to dialogue and the dissolution \nof armed groups.\nIn the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the United Nations \nnot only stayed and delivered but also rapidly scaled up \nits response across the country and beyond, including \nits refugee response.

Children with \ndisabilities and those displaced were most vulnerable. \nWe helped to verify at least 27,000 violations against \nchildren by government and non-State forces, including \nterrorist groups. More than 12,400 children formerly \nassociated with armed forces or groups benefited from \nprotection or  reintegration assistance during the year.\nWe drew global attention to the impacts of violence that \nchildren face before, during and after conflict, including \nforced displacement, abduction, trafficking, detention \nand adoption. We worked with Member States to \nstrengthen violence prevention and protection. We \nalso raised awareness about children living in camps \nand detention facilities, which requires alternative solutions. We urged States to prevent recurring \ncycles of violence by repatriating, rehabilitating and \nreintegrating their nationals.Over the past year, conflict, shrinking civic space and weakened rule of law also exposed civilians to more \nsexual violence. With our monitoring and reporting, \nwe helped to verify approximately 3,000 cases of \nconflict-related sexual violence. We launched a new \nglobal framework for the prevention of conflict-related \nsexual violence at the seventy-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. In Ukraine, we signed a framework \nagreement with the Government to address conflict-related sexual violence, and we are in the process of \nimplementing similar prevention plans in countries \nincluding the Central African Republic, the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Iraq and South Sudan. We are also working with regional organizations such as the \nAfrican Union and the League of Arab States to respond \nto sexual violence in conflict.\nWe monitored and raised the alarm over risks of \natrocity crimes and supported atrocity prevention. Our \nefforts resulted in action plans promoting the roles of \nwomen and traditional leaders in preventing atrocities, \nand the role of sports in countering hate speech. We also supported five United Nations country teams in developing action plans on hate speech. For the first \ntime ever, we brought people together to commemorate \nthe International Day for Countering Hate Speech on 18\u00a0June 2022.CHILDREN AND ARMED CONFLICT, VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN,

We helped to establish control \nmechanisms for financial flows, enhancing efficiency \nin public expenditures and creating accessible African private savings and sovereign funds. Our \nwork contributed to improving development finance \nand reducing dependence on foreign assistance. We \namplified calls to shift official development assistance \nfrom quantity to quality and advocated for a fairer \ninternational financial architecture. We also supported \neconomic transformation and resilience through trade, \nparticularly the Agreement Establishing the African \nContinental Free Trade Area.\nOn energy, we advocated for a just and equitable global \nenergy transition that acknowledges different starting \npoints and priorities. African countries want to take \ncharge of their energy future, so we supported energy \nplanning exercises across the continent to advance \nnational priorities.We continued to address the root causes of conflict through sustainable development that leaves no one \nbehind. We assisted Member States in promoting \nwomen\u2019s rights and their meaningful participation in \nall aspects of political, economic and social life. In \npartnership with Member States, we helped to prioritize \nthe strengthening of health systems in Africa. We also \nworked towards empowering more African youth as contributors in a shared global future. \nTogether with the African Union, we directed more \nglobal attention to nutrition and food security. With \nour \u201cDelivering as one\u201d approach, we leveraged the \nAfrica Dialogue Series to explain the issues, activate \npartnerships and broker knowledge to accelerate \nAfrica\u2019s development.\n105Governance value chain\nThe absence of the State is a structural problem that undermines the development potential of African countries.

In addition, \nhuman rights emergency response teams were \ndeployed in seven regional offices, strengthening our \ncapacity to anticipate and respond to human rights \ncrises and enhancing inter-agency cooperation on the \nprevention agenda. We also developed a new policy \nthat formally recognizes the linkages between sexual \nexploitation and abuse and human rights and provides \npractical guidance on a human rights-based, victim-\ncentred approach to preventing and responding to \nsexual exploitation and abuse. We are working closely \nwith United Nations country teams and United Nations \nentities on its implementation. \nNON-DISCRIMINATION\nWith our support, over 700 participants from States,  \ncivil society and the United Nations took part in \nthe inaugural session of the Permanent Forum on \nPeople of African Descent. This event will contribute \nto a United Nations declaration on the promotion, protection and full respect of the human rights of \npeople of African descent. We deployed anti-racial \ndiscrimination advisers to our regional human rights \noffices in Bangkok, Beirut, Brussels, Pretoria and Santiago to strengthen our capacity and support \nactions and stakeholders at the national level. We \nlaunched the \u201cLearn, speak up and act!\u201d campaign to raise awareness about racism, xenophobia and racial \ndiscrimination. We also introduced an online platform \nfor companies to assess their compliance with United \nNations standards of conduct for businesses to help \nto reduce discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender and intersex people.PARTICIPATION\nTo help to preserve and expand civic space, we \nfocused on safety for participants in public debates \nand decision-making, including by establishing \nhuman rights observatories and citizen platforms. \nWe built awareness and advocacy around this issue with a report on the human rights impact of Internet \nshutdowns. We also promoted the participation of the \nleast developed countries and small island developing \nStates in the Human Rights Council.  \nACCOUNTABILITY\nWe supported investigative mechanisms established by \nthe Human Rights Council, with mandates in more than \n10 countries and territories. Our advocacy contributed \nto the establishment of the International Independent \nExpert Mechanism to Advance Racial Justice and \nEquality in Law Enforcement.

With partners, we \nadvocate for humanitarian principles, promote respect \nfor international humanitarian and human rights law \nand mobilize resources to prepare for and respond \nto crises. Early action and rapid response, including \nthrough anticipatory approaches, remain crucial to \neffective coordination. The United Nations also brings \nGovernments, partners and communities together to \nreduce disaster risk and losses.  KEY OUTCOMES\nIn 2022, we coordinated humanitarian response plans for 216 million people across 69 countries \nand territories to ensure that they receive life-saving \nassistance and protection. With generous support from \ndonors, the United Nations and our partners mobilized \n$30 billion for these plans \u2013 a record, but still 40 per cent short of the $52 billion required. At the country level, our partners assisted 157 million people, or 79 per cent of the people originally targeted.\nNew and deteriorating crises, including in Afghanistan, \nEthiopia, Somalia and Ukraine, were the main focus \nof our work in 2022. In Ukraine, the United Nations \nand partners delivered humanitarian assistance and \nprotection to close to  16 million people, including $1.2 \nbillion in unprecedented cash assistance for nearly 6 million Ukrainians. In total, we helped to mobilize $5 billion for Ukraine and the region. We also helped to \nfacilitate the Black Sea Initiative, which cleared the \npassage of grain through the Black Sea. Together with \nthe Memorandum of Understanding on promoting \nRussian food products and fertilizers to the world \nmarkets, this Initiative reconnected a critical source \nof food and fertilizer supplies to world markets, easing \npressure on global food security and ultimately helping \nmillions of people.\nThe United Nations and partners continued to deliver \nsupport in Afghanistan. Over 26 million people, in \nparticular women and girls, received humanitarian \nassistance and protection, including in previously \ninaccessible locations. In Pakistan, heavy rains and \nfloods affected 33 million people, with 8 million people \ndisplaced. We supported the government-led disaster \nresponse with life-saving and livelihood assistance \nwhile preventing the outbreak of communicable \ndiseases.\nA joint team of humanitarian agencies

The first Meeting \nof States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of \nNuclear Weapons, the Eighth Biennial Meeting of States \nto Consider the Implementation of the Programme \nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \nAspects, and the Ninth Review Conference of the \nStates Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition \nof the Development, Production and Stockpiling of \nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on \nTheir Destruction all yielded important gains that will pave the way for future progress. Although the tenth \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons did not reach \nan outcome, States parties engaged in meaningful \ndiscussions, including on reducing nuclear risks and on accountability for nuclear disarmament. \nWe assisted expert discussions on lethal autonomous \nweapons systems. In addition, we supported an \nintergovernmental process aimed at ensuring a safe, \nsecure and peaceful cyber domain, and another on \nreducing space threats through norms, rules and \nprinciples.\nTo advance disarmament on the ground, we helped to \nlink local ammunition management with disarmament, \ndemobilization and reintegration, as well as community \nviolence reduction programmes. We also continued to \nsupport activities on small arms and light weapons \ncontrol as part of a comprehensive approach to \nsustainable security and development. To reduce illicit \narms flows, we worked with the African Union and \nsix countries to collect illegally held small arms. As \na result, more than 9,500 weapons were destroyed. \nThe Conference on Disarmament meets in Geneva to negotiate arms control and \nmultilateral disarmament agreements.  \n(Geneva; June 2022) \u00a9 UN Photo/Jean Marc Ferr\u00e9\u201cThe world needs a new \nvision for disarmament, one \nthat takes into account the \ngeopolitical, technological and cultural changes that have accelerated in recent \nyears.\u201d\nIzumi Nakamitsu, Under-Secretary-General and \nHigh Representative for Disarmament Affairs\n162\u2003DETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "536c801a-b98e-45b6-b0f3-32c1136cf688": {"__data__": {"id_": "536c801a-b98e-45b6-b0f3-32c1136cf688", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3011ed9-79e6-4245-83f1-969388c9643b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "77678ea77307219feb1fb2aa5e2f8a666d48723f6797ae859beddbc77b82f115", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad896faa-2683-456a-a318-41d8c91ce4bf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "cf8c67fb903aaed491b757419cdcd1c76a5bde4d31624f9dad749875faf869b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2103f0a-dc2c-4f18-bb3a-a123cb2948d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_path": "data/sg_annual_report_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38400395, "creation_date": "2023-11-24", "last_modified_date": "2023-10-31", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-24"}, "hash": "ec25c9d2229561bff4bdac3a943e2fc89d00f7591cf381f1732edb59b0c42db7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2894a50531922ac4e292d69b802da486c4e4451942252e8cfb19b4d0747c733e", "text": "DISARMAMENT DISARMAMENT DETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023 \u2003165 164\u2003DETERMINED: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION 2023DISARMAMENT \nCustoms officers in the Dominican Republic  \nbeing trained on arms, ammunition and trade \ncontrol in the context of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and the non-proliferation  \nof weapons of mass destruction.  \n(Santo Domingo; October 2022) \u00a9 UNLIREC\nDestruction of small arms and light weapons, 2016\u20132021\nDestruction of small arms and light weapons from 2016 to 2021, as reported biennially in the Programme of Action on Small Arms \nnational reports from Member States\n2016-2017 2018-2019 2020-2021756,000\n473,000573,000\n16505001,0001,5002 0002 500\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020Global military expenditure increased to a record $2.2 trillion\nWorld military expenditure by region 1988\u20132022\nNote: The absence of data for the Soviet Union in 1991 means that no total can be calculated for that year\nSource: SIPRI Military Expenditure Database, April 2023.
